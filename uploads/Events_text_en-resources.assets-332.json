  "m_Script": "The New Lama\r\nNow that we have decided on a historical compromise and are granting special autonomy to Tibet with its own government, we should decide who will be recognized by us as the new spiritual and political leader of Tibet. Thus, we have three possible candidates for this post, since only three of them correspond to all religious canons: Panchen Lama X, our religious Tibetan figure, who was subjected to prison persecution and then married a woman of Han origin. The fugitive Dalai Lama XIV, an old political dissident living in India, engaged in active political activity and has long been applying for this post. And the last option is the Soviet Hambo Lama, the spiritual leader of the Soviet Buddhists, an activist of the organization of the struggle for peace and the development of the Buddhist school. In the case of the first option, we have the least amount of risks, with the third option, we risk becoming dependent on the Soviet Union, and the most risky is the second option - despite the statements of the Dalai Lama that he stands only for autonomy, not separatism, he has long-standing contacts with our dissidents and American politicians. The choice is yours.\r\nOur Panchen Lama X.\r\nThe Fugitive Dalai Lama XIV.\r\nSoviet Hambo Lama.\r\nReached an agreement or rehabilitated Chokyi Gyaltsen.\r\nNo Maoism, no Cultural Revolution, diplomatic reputation < 40.0\r\nAn observer or a member of COMECON.\r\nPanchen Lama X previously received special support from the wives of Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, in particular, they saw an excellent political opportunity in creating a marriage of a Tibetan Lama with a Han girl. In the future, Gyaltsen became a deputy of the NPC and began to climb the career ladder of the NPC Permanent Council. And he really became the safest choice for the head of Tibet's own government. While remaining fully loyal to our government, he was primarily engaged in the restoration of old Buddhist temples, the reburial of Buddhist monks and the expansion of spiritual schools. In general, everything is calm in Tibet.\r\nThe Dalai Lama XIV got acquainted with the European way of life through the stories of a fugitive Nazi, himself living in exile, and then became a major political figure of the Tibetan government in exile. Being an anti-Chinese dissident activist, he nevertheless recognized that Tibet can only count on autonomy. The contact of our representatives came as a deep surprise to him, but during long and difficult negotiations we were able to find a compromise: he dissolves the government in exile and recognizes the central authority, in exchange for which he becomes the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan Autonomy, and also confirms the exile of that part of his political allies who were outspoken or open supporters of separatism. The new regime is not loyal to us, but it is moderate enough and we can try to use it for our own purposes.\r\nZhambal-Dorji Gomboev, the 19th Pandito Hambo Lama, was recognized by us as a suitable spiritual leader of Tibet. A brave fighter during the Great Patriotic War, he was one of the founders of the Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace, the initiator of the creation of the Buddhist University in Ulaanbaatar, the organizer of the construction of the Ivolginsky Datsan complex, petitioned the USSR government for the return and restoration of destroyed monasteries. After becoming the spiritual and political head of Tibet, he chose the most peaceful but spiritually enlightened personalities among the local Tibetans and began implementing a program for the development of spiritual and educational institutions throughout Tibet. The new Lama paid special attention to the fight against poverty and illiteracy, as well as the fight against remnants of Tibetan traditions.\r\nZhimba Zhamso Erdyneev, the 20th Pandito Hambo Lama, was recognized by us as a suitable spiritual leader of Tibet. Having survived the repressions of the Stalinist period, he did not become an anti-Soviet or dissident, but went to work as a librarian and engaged in self-education, both spiritual and secular. As a new Hambo Lama, he gained wide respect due to his erudition and excellent knowledge of sacred treatises, actively participated in the Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace, was a member of the Soviet Peace Protection Committee. Having assumed the post of spiritual and political leader of Tibet, he actively engaged not only in the development of spiritual and educational institutions in the region, but also attracted Tibetans to participate in the Soviet Peace Foundation, in particular, centers of charitable headquarters were organized on the territory of Tibet to help victims of wars and disasters from around the world. The Chinese leadership can be proud of its contribution to the salvation of mankind. \r\n200-\r\n  200 {0}\r\n 1\r\n 2\r\n\r\n2 \r\nThe Vietnam War\r\nOur troops were able to defeat the enemy in border clashes and begin advancing inland, but the further we go, the more problems we face. The Vietnamese army successfully uses the impassable terrain to its advantage, and in the already captured regions, the PLA has to deal with guerrillas who actively disrupt our supply lines. Some of the military leadership and party members insist that we need to immediately stop the military operation and hush up the incident. Others suggest contacting the UN and negotiating concessions from Vietnam in exchange for the cessation of offensive actions and the withdrawal of our troops. Nevertheless, we can continue the offensive, we have a great mobilization potential, we outnumber Vietnam in manpower and weapons, and sooner or later we will crush their defenses if we periodically send reinforcements to the front. However, you can end everything right now by striking the enemy with a nuclear strike, even if the consequences of this will be truly catastrophic.\r\nStop at what has been achieved.\r\nWe are resolving the issue through the UN.\r\nWe will not compromise with capitalists and revisionists!\r\nWe continue the war.\r\nMay the nuclear sun of Mao Zedong rise!\r\nWe will not launch a nuclear strike first, even against the revisionists.\r\nWe were unable to achieve our goals. It was decided to withdraw troops immediately. It became obvious that our army needed urgent reforms and modernization, and the party should deal with the personified causes of failure. Vietnam, on the other hand, is strengthening its own borders, demanding reparations from us, and is already negotiating with the USSR on the deployment of a Soviet contingent of troops on its territory and has applied to join the Warsaw Pact, the adoption of which is only a matter of time.\r\nSeeing the failures at the front, we turned to diplomatic methods. Soon, at a meeting of the UN Security Council, the question of solving problems with Vietnam was raised. Taking advantage of our influence and the favor of the United States, we were able to push our will on most issues and Vietnam even ceded part of the continental territories to us. This decision allowed us to save face, despite widespread discontent from the USSR and a number of other countries. After that, the Vietnamese government strengthened military and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and began conducting periodic military exercises near our borders.\r\nWe don't need negotiations! We have a huge advantage in the number of weapons and manpower. We will methodically crush their defenses, despite the military and economic losses.\r\nAt 5:00 a.m., an H-6 bomber flew into the air, heading for Hanoi. On board was a thermonuclear bomb with a capacity of 3 megatons. Soon, only burning ruins remained of the capital of Vietnam. By the end of the day, nuclear mushrooms had grown over many other cities and industrial centers in Vietnam. The PLA is breaking through the Vietnamese defenses in all directions. This is an absolute victory, but was it worth it? \r\nProblems in the army?\r\nIn the war with Vietnam, the PLA showed itself from far from the best side. Unfortunately, this fact can no longer be denied, and therefore we need an urgent modernization of the army. Of course, we can conduct it on our own, but some party members are offered to enlist the help of our former enemies...\r\nWe have no problems in the army. The traitors from the party are to blame for the defeat, it's better to deal with them! \r\nYes, we need rearmament. Give an order to urgently begin the modernization of the armed forces and the development of new weapons.\r\nUnfortunately, we are too weak to modernize our army. \r\nLet's turn to the USA for help.\r\nHelp from the imperialists is unacceptable!\r\nIt is obvious that our army showed its best side and fought valiantly against the enemy. But those responsible for the defeat are sitting in the party and they need to be dealt with urgently! \r\nIt was decided to urgently begin the modernization of the army. A few months later, tests of the ZTZ79 tank and the J-8 interceptor fighter began. Personnel changes also began in the army, and all commanders whose units did not perform well were demoted or sent for retraining.\r\nNegotiations with the United States on the modernization of our army began through closed channels, and within a few months the newest American tanks and combat aircraft entered service. Soldiers are now being helped to train by Western instructors. Our army will be much better prepared for the next war, even if in the eyes of the USSR we now look like henchmen of the imperialists. \r\nSolving issues at the party level\r\nThe war with Vietnam cannot be called successful at all. But to lay the blame on the armed forces alone would be a great folly. The war itself and the actual defeat in it are the fault of individual party members and they need to be dealt with. On whom is it better to pin all the blame? On the left-wing radicals, accusing them of starting the war and revolutionary frenzy with shapkozakidatelskimi moods, divorced from reality? Or the liberals, who conspired with the imperialists, sabotaged useful initiatives on the fronts? Or maybe it's better not to provoke wars in the party once again and make do with general accusations of abstract wreckers and the resignation of the most odious minor figures of both factions?\r\nTo do with general words.\r\nBlame the left-wing deviators.\r\nThe influence of the left-wing radicals was not so significant.\r\nBlame the liberals.\r\nThe influence of the Liberals was not so significant.\r\nAt the next meeting of the party, you accused some pests of defeat in the war. The party understood that you don't want conflicts, but didn't it play against you, showing your weakness in the eyes of all factions?\r\nThe damned left-wing radicals, following their fantasies about the world revolution, almost sent our country into another crisis caused by a war devouring all resources! It is these pests that are to blame for the war itself, and for our failure! It is on their hands that the blood of our soldiers, whom they threw into reckless offensives, is on their hands! Start purging these traitors!\r\nTraitor liberals have caused our failures! Their vile collusion with the imperialists did not allow us to win the war! Their opportunistic ideas about market socialism and openness to the world cost the lives of our people! Death to the right-wing pests! \r\nNuclear war\r\nOur nuclear strikes could not remain without consequences. The very next day, an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council was convened, where our fate is being decided, and intelligence reports that the nuclear missiles of the USSR and the USA are already aimed at us and the troops are receiving plans to launch military operations against the PRC. Of course, nothing will break our revolutionary spirit, and we will defend ourselves against the whole world, because we can turn them into radioactive ashes. But can it be worth quietly removing from power those madmen who have put the world on the brink of destruction and make concessions to humanity? \r\nThere will be no peaceful solution!\r\nArrest the radicals.\r\nBut we did the nuclear strikes, not the left-wing radicals...\r\nOur cities have become nuclear wastelands, but our missiles are also flying at the enemies. You took refuge in a bunker with your colleagues. But thousands of reports about tens of millions of dead do not allow you to make decisions sensibly, your head is splitting and the idea that there will be no winners here and the world will never be the same stands out more and more...\r\nYou gave the order and soon the leadership of the left-wing radicals was placed under arrest. The UN, the USSR and the USA received reports that criminals were responsible for nuclear strikes, that party members responsible to the world community had already been eliminated. You are ready to bear all the consequences in the form of serious economic and reputational losses. And also international bodies will surely demand a serious reduction in the army and the elimination of all nuclear weapons. But it's a small price to pay for the world. Prepare the left-wing radicals for the international tribunal. \r\nThe Rise of Hua Guofeng\r\nAfter Mao's death, the leading posts of the state are occupied by his conditional \"successor\" Hua Guofeng. Initially, a moderate politician seemed like a good option that would suit all factions, but, alas, he turned out to be an unsuccessful and inept leader. The development of the country is being slowed down, and there is no party unity even in dreams. Guofeng does not suit either left-wing radicals or reformists. There is already talk among party members that the heir to Mao is starting to build his own authoritarian model of power. But is it so bad and maybe it's better to clean up the ranks of radicals, rather than remove a strong leader?\r\nGuofeng will suit us.\r\nAccuse him of revisionism on the one hand, and of supporting Maoist totalitarianism on the other, and dismiss him.\r\nThe conspiracy against Guofeng did not find support among the party.\r\nAt the next party meeting, the question was raised about the resignation of Chairman Hua Guofeng, on whom all the failures of the country were hung. In the vote, everyone unanimously supported the resignation and soon Guofeng lost his posts and was sent to his dacha, where he would soon die in a few weeks. From natural causes, of course.\r\nXiaoping's resignation?\r\nIn recent years, Deng Xiaoping has been rising more and more in the party. He and his supporters are picking up an increasing number of government posts. And it would be possible to turn a blind eye to this if his views were not very dubious. Yes, his ideas are still very soft, but in conversations with like-minded people, he is already discussing the complete liberalization of the country. And some information about his cooperation with Western intelligence services is also being received... Is it worth organizing a conspiracy against the rising cryptoliberal?\r\nLets keep Xiaoping. \r\nLet's dismiss the revisionist!\r\nXiaoping is the future of China! The horrors of Maoism will remain in the past! A bright future of freedom and openness awaits us!\r\nA unanimous criticism of Deng Xiaoping's ideas and activities began at the party meeting. The left-wing radicals accused him of revisionism, while the moderates feared losing power. In total, by the end of the meeting, Xiaoping had lost all hope, because even his former allies had turned on him. The ambitious former politician, who lost all his posts, was forced to leave the capital and, shocked by his collapse, soon died quietly of heart disease...\r\nProtests against the leading party line\r\nObviously, not everything in our country is perfect, and many people are dissatisfied with the party policy. Of course, the people are incited by revisionists and foreign agents, but maybe this is our chance to change the power structure a little? At the same time, the crackdown on protests will cause a drop in people's trust and international reputation.\r\nDisperse the people.\r\nWe can publicly dismiss Hu Yaobang to calm the people and the party. \r\nLet's use the protests for a party coup.\r\nThe situation in the cities was stabilized by the army. It was possible to do almost without the dead and arrested, even if the people's trust was undermined, and the protests were shot from tanks in the Western press.\r\nYaobang was retired and soon died of a myocardial infarction. The people are happy, and the party members too, for the left he was revisionists, the moderates were not satisfied with the radicality of his ideas, and it is advantageous for the liberals to hang all their sins on a former colleague...\r\nThe party supported the protests and staged a split. The ruling faction was left without support, and even the army abandoned them. Soon a new government was established in the country, and the old rulers either died of old age or were convicted of treason.\r\nConvicted Red Guards\r\nAfter the failed Cultural Revolution, many of the Red Guards were sent to prison to stabilize the situation. But years have passed, and it may be worth releasing them, after all, we already firmly hold power, and there were useful specialists among the former radicals, and the people did not treat the crackdown on Red Guards very well, the release will increase our support. But the main thing to remember is that returning them to their former positions can strongly incline the country to a radical past.\r\nLet them serve their prison term further.\r\nRelease them.\r\nRelease and return to the party and to positions.\r\nThere's no need to return them. They have already caused the country to fall into the abyss and millions of deaths. We need stability, not revolutionary fantasies.\r\nThe Red Guards were released from prison, but deprived of power. The party as a whole met it calmly, after all, a lot of time has passed, but your support among the people has increased, yet many relatives have returned to their families, so also some of the former radicals have changed their shoes and now support you. \r\nThe Red Guards were released from prison and returned to government posts. Among the right-wing factions of the party, there are cries of criticism in your direction, but they are compensated by the support of the Red Guards and the party left. Of course, there has been an increase in left-wing radicals, but this is certainly better than the dominance of marketeers and right-wing revisionists pushing the country into the arms of imperialists! \r\nBig Circle \r\nAfter the collapse of the cultural revolution, the Red Guards were dispersed, and some of them went to prison. Now, after several years without finding a place in modern China, former leftist radicals have founded a criminal syndicate in Hong Kong and their influence is already increasing in the countries of Southeast Asia and North America. We could establish cooperation with them to have a greater influence on the policies of foreign countries. Of course, it will not be free and the mafiosi will want to influence our party as well.\r\nThere is no need for this.\r\nStart negotiations with the mafia.\r\nSuch an idea is unacceptable for civilized countries!\r\nIt is unacceptable for us to cooperate with the mafia. It is better to provide data on its members to the foreign police.\r\nIn one of the Hong Kong restaurants, there was a regular meeting of business Chinese. At least, it seemed so from the outside. In fact, there were behind-the-scenes negotiations with the syndicate leaders, as a result of which we promised them patronage in their criminal affairs and promote their representatives in the ranks of ours, and they in turn agreed to represent our interests in the United States and \"convince\" local politicians of our goodwill. Despite the dissatisfaction of some party members with this decision, we now have a powerful tool to promote our interests abroad.\r\nThe fate of Chen Yun \r\nSome party members are beginning to intrigue against Chen Yun. Of course, this is an old party member who has been with us since the revolutionary struggle, but after our victory he repeatedly spoke about the need to introduce market mechanisms into the economy. He was also one of those responsible for the so-called Big Leap, which cannot be called completely successful and, perhaps, Chen Yun was also to blame for its failure...\r\nLeave him alone.\r\nIt seems that we have found the culprit for our failures.\r\nThe plot failed; Chen Yun was protected by the rest of the party members.\r\nAt the next party meeting, Chen Yun was blamed for the failure of the Big Leap policy. After that, he was taken into custody, and soon a criminal case began, which ended with the shooting of a pest and a pro-Western opportunist.\r\nPeng Zhen's Fate \r\nAt the next party meeting, the question arose about Peng Zheng: a former supporter of Mao, who turned away from him after the failure of the Big Leap and criticized Maoism, for which he was then accused of kapputism and exiled. Some still see him as a liberal revisionist and an enemy of China. But his sins are not so great, even if he cooperates with dubious personalities, maybe it's worth leaving the old party member alone, he doesn't have long left anyway...\r\nRehabilitate Peng Zhen.\r\nDeal with him once and for all.\r\nThe party considered the charges against Peng Zhen too far-fetched and unfounded. During rehabilitation, he was appointed acting Chairman of the Commission on Legislative Work of the 5th convocation of the NPC Party Congress.\r\nThe accusations of liberalism turned out to be too heavy for Peng Zhen's career and health. After severe criticism, he left the meeting and died soon after. Of course, for natural reasons. Liberals are unhappy, but who cares?\r\nThe fate of Wang Zhen \r\nCompromising materials on General Wang Zhen have fallen into your hands. The charges there are quite serious, ranging from sexual crimes to links with organized crime. This would be an excellent opportunity to remove from the party a supporter of liberal reforms, who at the same time opposes the liberalization of society and politics. But is it worth touching an old colleague of Comrade Mao? \r\nHush up the case.\r\nStart a major lawsuit.\r\nThe compromising materials on Zhen were sent to the archive, where they were accidentally lost.\r\nYou ordered the criminal proceedings against Wang Zhen to begin. A former military man, and now a former party member, appeared before the court and, to all charges supported by serious evidence, only shouted about a case fabricated by his enemies. But this is just an attempt to excuse himself, and therefore soon Zhen was shot for links with drug dealers and treason. \r\nLi Xiannian's Fate\r\nSome in the party have found another culprit for economic failures - Li Xiannian. The charges, of course, are weak, but the crimes are serious, and they are enough for resignation. Moreover, stupidity can always be explained by a conspiracy...\r\nDeclare the charges fabricated.\r\nTo inflate the harassment.\r\nAccusations against Comrade Li were heard from marginal left-wing radicals. By eliminating a prominent party member, they wanted to strengthen their worthless position! We will not allow this!\r\nSure. Li Xiannian is guilty of economic failures! This is obvious from the documents read out! And how could Comrade Mao's former colleague be simply incapable and stupid? Of course not! There is clearly a conspiracy with the enemies of China! \r\nThe decline in the quality of education\r\nComrade, local authorities are sending more and more messages that both the quality of education and the literacy rate are falling more and more. For the most part, this is chaos in the education system, which has been going on since the events of the so-called \"cultural revolution\". The problem is quite serious and in the long term negatively affects the pace of our development. Our experts offer several solutions: 1. Comprehensive education reform with partial de-ideologization, which will have a positive impact on the quality of education, but may serve to nurture alternative opinions from the general line of the party. 2. Infusion of large funds for the restoration of schools and universities, raising teachers' salaries. 3. Or if we do not have enough funds or political will for reforms, our Respected Leader can make an inspiring speech about the importance of education, which, however, will not affect the situation in any way.\r\nMake a speech about the importance of education.\r\nAllocate more money for this.\r\nWe don't have enough funds.\r\nTo carry out a large-scale education reform.\r\nWe especially don't have such money.\r\nAt the party meeting, you made a speech about the great importance of education in state-building. True, the words remained words, and only some students began to sleep less, spending time with books...\r\nThe situation with education was not the best, and therefore it was decided to allocate additional funds. The construction of new schools and universities and the modernization of existing ones began, along with an increase in teachers' salaries. This will make it possible to improve the situation with education in the long term.\r\nBy the decision of the party, a large-scale reform of the entire education system was carried out, subjects of dubious value were reduced, and the programs for the rest were changed to be closer to modern scientific achievements. At the same time, systematically conducting deideologization in the exact sciences. We can expect that in a few years we will feel a strong positive impact from the reform.\r\nThe downed Korean Boeing\r\nOn September 1, 1983, a South Korean Boeing 747-230B passenger plane was shot down over the Pacific Ocean near the borders of the USSR. 269 people are reported dead, making the disaster one of the largest in history. Western media are already calling this incident a crime against humanity that should never be forgotten, spontaneous protests against the actions of the Soviet Union are already actively taking place in the United States and the Republic of Korea. But our intelligence from the USSR reports that not everything is so unambiguous - the plane violated the USSR border, flew near secret objects, did not respond to requests from dispatchers and pilots. And there was increased tension in the region before the incident due to the fact that American aircraft have repeatedly violated the airspace of the Soviet Union since 1982. What should we do in this situation? We can join the international condemnation by improving relations with the Western world, but spoiling with the USSR. Or to act pragmatically, without commenting on the situation in any way? We can also support the USSR in this situation and declare the inadmissibility of violating state borders.\r\nDo not comment on the situation in any way.\r\nCondemn the USSR.\r\nSupport the USSR.\r\nThe Chinese government has not officially commented on the situation. Only some representatives expressed their condolences to the families of the victims. It is already obvious that the Catastrophe caused a serious aggravation of the already difficult relations between the USSR and the USA at that time.\r\nOur press as a whole repeated the theses of the Western media, demanding to call the perpetrators to account. We also sent a protest note to the USSR Ambassador, and our representative at the UN called for an international investigation of the disaster. These actions found sympathy from the Western powers, but caused dissatisfaction with the government of the USSR, which, however, began negotiations with the United States and Japan on the creation of a unified system for tracking the movement of air transport over the North Pacific Ocean.\r\nThe crash was solely the fault of the Boeing crew and the US military, who conducted repeated provocations near the border with the USSR. This was the official statement of the PRC on the disaster situation. This naturally caused dissatisfaction with the Western media and official representatives and generally worsened our relations with the Western world. But on the other hand, our relations with the Soviet Union have improved significantly, the representative of the USSR expressed gratitude to us, and also offered to establish direct cooperation between the Air Forces of the People's Republic of China and the USSR in order to respond effectively to such situations in the future.\r\nTake an example from Japan\r\nAfter World War II, Japan demonstrated amazing economic growth rates of about 10% annually, becoming the second country in the world in nominal economic power, surpassing France, Italy, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, the USSR and second only to the United States. In the West, they even called it a \"Japanese economic miracle.\" But many liberals insist that such success is caused by non-market methods in the form of merging big business and the state. The left accused the country's leadership of enslaving working conditions, overworking workers and creating a corporate culture in the country. But we can consider their experience in our country, taking into account our specifics...\r\nNo. It is unacceptable for our country to adopt the experience of bourgeois economists! \r\nYes, after certain problems of the past decades, our economy needs new methods for the development of production.\r\nJapan is a state of brutal exploitation of workers, moreover, completely controlled by the US imperialists from abroad! Do not forget their past crimes, for which they did not even repent. Their methods are unacceptable to us!\r\nJapanese methods are quite interesting... They can be useful to our economy, and they will strengthen ties with our eastern neighbor...\r\nRapprochement with Japan?\r\nAfter applying Japanese methods in our country, some party members had ideas about political rapprochement with Japan and further trade integration, which would increase our influence in Asia. Of course, Japan is now an American puppet, but is it that important? After all, they are Asians, not Western imperialists...\r\nRapprochement is unacceptable.\r\nSend an embassy.\r\nYes, of course, we have adopted their methods, but do not forget the past and present of this country. They brought a lot of suffering to our country and Asia as a whole, but because of the convenient situation for the United States, they did not suffer any retribution. There will be no rapprochement until Japan comes to its senses!\r\nWe have had contradictions in the past, but still we should maintain at least non-negative relations with our neighbors, because the security of our country is in the first place for us. And the desire to overcome differences will increase our prestige. \r\nForgive the past?\r\nIt has been more than 40 years since the Japanese crimes on our territory. Of course, these are all horrific tragedies, but we won, the criminals were convicted at the trials, and the Japanese government has not been the same for a long time. It's time to forgive all their past sins for the sake of stability and friendly relations between our countries. But such a decision will be very unpopular among the people and the party.\r\nCrimes have no statute of limitations!\r\nOur friendship and mutual prosperity are more important than the past.\r\nNo, there will be no rapprochement. The relatives of the victims are still alive, and they will not understand us in any way. And the Japanese themselves did not realize anything and still revere the executioners.\r\nIt's time to forgive Japan's past. After all, it's been a long time. It is foolish to accuse modern Japanese who were born after the war that they are to blame for something. Yes, the leadership is still visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, but it is obvious to everyone that this is a reaction to condemnation from other Asian countries. There will be further rapprochement.\r\nWill our forces be brought to power in Japan?\r\nOur countries have become very close in recent years, and our agents have more and more influence in the land of the rising sun. The party can even influence domestic politics... and we could bring someone to power who will make us closer. On the one hand, there are the CPJ, which are much closer to us, but still this party has many contradictions between the right-wing bias of Kenji Miyamoto, a former radical, and now an active promoter of reformism and opportunism, and the moderate-left pro-Chinese anti-monarchist forces led by our long-time friend and PLA fighter during the war with Japan, Sanzo Nosaka. On the other hand, we have Japanese nationalists associated with the army, and, of course, these are fascists. But on the other hand, they will agree to cooperate and are sharply negative towards the United States.\r\nWe don't have enough funds.\r\nBring the CPJ to power.\r\nBring the militarists to power.\r\nYes, of course, a change of leadership in Japan would be useful to us, but still, unfortunately, it will destabilize the situation in the region, from which nothing good will be for sure, and the states will react extremely negatively.\r\nThe CPJ came to power in Japan having successfully formed a one-party government thanks to extensive economic injections during the election campaign. At first, everything was extremely unstable - party splits, problems with the bourgeoisie, and the reluctance of the United States to withdraw troops. But now socialism is being built in Japan, and where the stars and stripes used to fly next to the flag of Japan, our red banner is now raised.\r\nJapanese tanks entered Tokyo and other major cities at night. The next morning, the entire Japanese government was shot on live television. The American bases were put under blockade and forced to evacuate. The number of victims has not been disclosed, but according to our intelligence, there are no more than two or three thousand. Of course, the new government declares nationalism and independence, but in conditions of international isolation, they are forced to cooperate with us, even if it is not very pleasant for them.\r\nMechanization of agriculture\r\nOur agriculture, despite decades of independence, still remains with an extremely low degree of mechanization, which negatively affects the development of the country - it requires a lot of workers in the countryside, which could be directed to production in the industrial sphere. On the one hand, we could start development on our own, but this requires the capacity of industry and engineers. But still, maybe it's worth buying equipment abroad in the USSR or other countries?\r\nWe have more important tasks. \r\nLet's start our own developments.\r\nWe don't have the resources for that.\r\nBuy equipment from the USSR.\r\nTrade with the Social imperialists is unacceptable!\r\nBuy equipment in the West.\r\nTrade with bourgeois countries is unacceptable!\r\nMechanization of agriculture is not a priority area, we have other tasks. And the flow of the proletariat into the cities will cause its impoverishment... Do we need this?\r\nWe carried out mechanization on our own. Yes, it took some resources, but still we must strive for independence from the hostile outside world. Agricultural machinery of our own production is based on the best practices and traits of Soviet samples, but in the future it will be developed with the help of domestic technologies. This gave an impetus to the development of not only agriculture, but also industry, and engineers are already thinking about how to apply the solutions found in military equipment. \r\nOur delegation went to the USSR, where, despite the conflicts in the past, we were able to negotiate the purchase of agricultural machinery, among which were advanced tractors T-40 and YUMZ-6. Now our villages have received more active development and improved harvest indicators. Relations with the Soviet Union have also improved.\r\nSome contracts were signed for the purchase of machinery in the United States, in particular a batch of the newest tractors of the John Deere 4440 model, which is one of the most advanced in the world. Our farmers are already reporting high-quality construction equipment and rare breakdowns, thereby contributing to a record harvest. Such a deal has also raised our image on the international market, and some foreign companies are already expressing interest in selling their agricultural machinery to us.\r\nLarge-scale project\r\nFor the development of agriculture, some engineers proposed a large-scale project of a new irrigation system, including the turning of rivers and the construction of many channels similar to what was implemented by Stalin in the Soviet Union, and continues on a smaller scale to this day. The project will be extremely useful for a number of northern regions, but the costs for it are truly enormous. It is unlikely that our resources will be enough for this. But a number of party members advise to attract resources from abroad. Or is it an adventure harmful to nature in general?\r\nCancel the project.\r\nStart construction. \r\nThere are no resources for this.\r\nTo attract foreign funds. \r\nWe can't sell out our country!\r\nThe commission of environmental scientists evaluated the proposed project, and their verdict was disappointing - the project is destructive to nature. It will entail climate change and the instant extinction of many species. The long-term consequences cannot be estimated at all. We cannot take such responsibility.\r\nThe project has been implemented, our agriculture has begun to develop extremely rapidly and there is no longer a problem of food shortage in the country, and soon we will be able to start exporting products from surplus. Foreign engineers come to China to get acquainted with our experience. At the same time, a number of scientists express concern about such a project, which may adversely affect the ecology of not only PRC, but also neighboring countries. \r\nThe project was assessed as unaffordable for our economy, therefore it was decided to attract foreign investment, which, however, was not enough for the full implementation of the project, and it was decided to reduce the scope of the campaign. In general, this has had a very good effect on the image of our country, but it will take more than one year to pay off the debts.\r\nThe village needs fertilizers\r\nThe whole history of the development of agriculture is inextricably linked with the use of fertilizers, so the intensive development of agricultural production is unthinkable without them. Developed countries are already actively using chemical mineral fertilizers to enrich the soil, which contributes to a multiple increase in yield. We can start developing chemical fertilizers on our own, which will take some time and money to organize production, or we can immediately start purchasing foreign fertilizers and immediately start fertilizing the soil next season. But maybe it's not worth experimenting with chemistry and continuing to use organic fertilizers as before, but at the cost of lower yields?\r\nWe have more important tasks. \r\nLet's start our development. \r\nWe don't have the resources for that. \r\nPurchase a foreign one. \r\nThey won't sell us.\r\nWe have more important tasks, and the development of chemical fertilizers can also cause poisoning in the population...\r\nOur scientists soon developed the latest chemical fertilizers, and our farmers actively began to use them. Right now we can already talk about increasing yields and meeting demand, let's see how this will affect the health of the population in the long term.\r\nOur trade missions purchased the latest foreign samples of fertilizers, after which Chinese agriculture received the strongest development. And more and more countries want to trade with us in the world. \r\nRoad development\r\nIn recent years, the number of cars has been growing among the population. Of course, this is good, because it is a sign of a growing standard of living. But on the other hand, we have a problem with the availability of cities. To many provinces, only dirt or railways still lead, and highways in the developed part of the country are already often in traffic jams. Engineers are sending messages that we urgently need to develop road infrastructure - to build new highways and expand old ones. But will there be enough resources for this? \r\nThere are more important tasks.\r\nStart construction.\r\nWe don't have the resources.\r\nCan we turn to the experience of Germany with its autobahns?\r\nNo connection with the bourgeoisie! \r\nYes, roads should be built, but we do not have so much free money and industrial capacity. \r\nOur industry has thrown its resources into the production of concrete and asphalt. And soon large-scale road works began all over the country. The new system has connected all cities with wide highways and at least one paved road leads to each village. The people are happy, and it is now easier for industry to bring resources.\r\nOur engineers went to West Germany to study their experience in the construction of autobahns. Soon, specialists from both countries returned to China and started work. Yes, it took more resources, but now our roads have become an example for the whole world - because they are made on the basis of the best in the world, but only taking into account modern technologies. Relations between PRC and FRG have become much warmer, and German engineers and investors already want to participate in our other projects. \r\nPrivate education\r\nAn initiative group of party members comes up with a proposal to legalize private educational institutions, arguing that this will reduce part of the burden from the state, will improve the quality of education and stimulate the introduction of new educational methods. But, on the other hand, it will weaken ideological control over the country's education, increase the stratification of the population due to the high cost of education and may cause misunderstanding both in the party and among the people. If we do decide to privatize education, then it is worth deciding exactly how this will happen. Some propose partial privatization, allowing the work of only those institutions to which the government will issue state accreditation, while others insist that such pressure from the state will not fully implement the reforms and call for giving full carte blanche to private schools. But irreconcilable conservatives and left-wing radicals categorically oppose and demand that those who proposed such vile reforms be excluded from the party.\r\nThere can be no private education!\r\nPartially allow but put under state control. \r\nPrivatization is unacceptable! \r\nCompletely privatize the education sector.\r\nPrivatization is unacceptable! \r\nThe privatization of education was harshly rejected, and the \"comrades\" who proposed this idea have already been expelled from the party. Thanks to an extensive propaganda campaign, the people found out about the rejected offer, which greatly increased your popularity.\r\nBy agreeing with the reformers' proposal, you gave the go-ahead for the limited privatization of educational institutions, which, however, will have to comply with a number of strict criteria in order to obtain state accreditation and a license to conduct educational activities. New educational institutions are already actively starting to purchase modern equipment and develop new teaching methods.\r\nTo everyone's surprise, you gave the green light for the introduction of private education in the country. A considerable part of educational institutions has been privatized and transferred to private hands. New educational institutions are already beginning to actively purchase modern equipment and develop experimental teaching methods and attract the attention of students with their innovations. However, such a decision caused a mixed reaction among the people. While the well-to-do part of the population welcomed such a decision and highly appreciated the quality of education, while the rest complained about unaffordable tuition prices and began to accuse the government of betraying the ideas of the revolution. Western countries have welcomed the reform and are already showing a desire for international cooperation and student exchange, which will positively affect both the quality of education and the image of our country.\r\nSubway in China?\r\nThe subway system was opened in Hong Kong today. In our country, there is only 1 system, which began to be built together with Soviet specialists before the Soviet-Chinese split, and then was completed with the help of French specialists to a satisfactory condition. Given this, should we open subways in other cities? This event will raise the prestige of the country and greatly improve urban logistics, but at the same time it will require significant investments, and without foreign specialists we will not be able to create modern systems.\r\nWe have more important tasks.\r\nLet's start the construction on our own.\r\nOur resources will not allow this.\r\nLet's call the Soviet specialists.\r\nNo help from the revisionists!\r\nYes, the metro is important, but we have much more important tasks now. Urbanization, for example.\r\nSoon the construction of new subways began. This was our first experience of working without foreign specialists and technologies, but in the end it allowed us to reduce the traffic load on the roads and increase the mobility of citizens.\r\nSoviet specialists were involved in the construction of our subways. Thanks to this, our metro has become one of the most advanced in the world, which has significantly improved the mobility of citizens and reduced the traffic load on the roads. And relations with the Soviet Union have improved significantly.\r\nHigh-speed railways?\r\nOur management was asked to connect the largest cities with high-speed train lines. This will seriously improve communication between parts of the country, but again it will require a lot of resources... Do we need it?\r\nWe have other tasks.\r\nWe will build one line between Beijing and Shanghai.\r\nYou do realize that one line is just for show, right? \r\nStart a program to connect all major cities.\r\nIt doesn't make sense.\r\nThe program of connecting cities with high-speed railway lines has been canceled. Still, we have other areas that need resources. And the example of Japan does not show that this is effective - in fact, if earlier it took a conditional 5 hours to get from one city to another, now the train is only 2, but because they go less often, you often have to wait the same 5 hours. So there is no point in such a system.\r\nSoon the first (and only) line between Beijing and Shanghai was completed and solemnly launched. On live TV, our leader boarded a train and arrived in Shanghai just a few hours later. The advertising is amazing, of course, but not everyone appreciated such an ostentatious resource investment.\r\nA new plan for the construction of high-speed railways was adopted and soon new lines between cities began to open. The people, of course, are happy, and let some economists grumble about high costs, but the standard of living has grown a lot, and even Japanese engineers come to get acquainted with our system.\r\nThe 1978 Constitution\r\nMao is dead, and therefore our country needs to choose a path to the future. Obviously, it should be reflected in the constitution. And hundreds of proposals from representatives of various parties are already arriving, but if we take, in general, we have 4 projects = from the ultra-left, from conservatives and moderates, from reformists and other moderates and from liberals. Of course, the adoption of any constitution will strengthen the faction that proposed it. The left-wing radicals want to begin a return to the days of Mao and the Cultural Revolution. The conservative faction stands for the preservation of the current system, but with gradual socialist reforms. Reformists support some liberalization and expansion of the private sector in the economy. And the liberals... it's clear enough here - a return to capitalism. So which way will China go? \r\nThe project of the ultra-left. \r\nThe project of moderates and conservatives. \r\nThe project of moderates and reformists. \r\nThe Liberals' project. \r\nLeave the current constitution.\r\nA draft left-wing constitution was adopted. Now our country has explicitly stated that it is endowed with the historical mission of realizing the revolution and is the home and center of the modern revolutionary proletarian movement, denies \"bourgeois\" human rights and gives even more power to the party organs and Red Guards. Massive repression against supporters of other factions was in fact legalized, while at the same time the constitution enshrined the inalienable right to work, education, medicine and housing. \r\nThe draft constitution of conservatives and moderates was adopted. Now we officially declare the observance of workers' rights and proletarian democracy.: the powers of the councils had been extended again, the Rabkrin was created, the state and party organs had been separated. In many ways the constitution is similar to the late Leninist constitution of 1924, in that the party still remains the vanguard and ruler of the country and subordinates the Soviets, special services and ministries to itself. Of course, the constitution was adapted to our realities, changed somewhat and mentions of Chairman Mao were included in it.\r\nThe draft constitution of moderates and reformers was adopted. Yes, the country really needed changes, and now our path is a slow path to socialism through gradual reforms and changes. \"There was no capitalism in China and we should go through its phase, but of course under the strict supervision of the Communist Party.\" Immediately there were expanded rights for entrepreneurs and economic freedoms in general. Of course, the power of the Soviets has been reduced, but we are still moving towards socialism.\r\nA draft constitution from the liberals was adopted. This came as a shock to many party members and citizens. Now the CPC is not officially the only or even the ruling party. We are just one of the parties participating in democratic bourgeois elections. And property rights have been significantly expanded. Of course, this is still only the constitution, but it is likely that its articles will soon be implemented in reality...\r\nThere are already many problems with unity in the party at the moment. Each faction pulls power on itself and does not want to negotiate. The adoption of the constitution will seriously strengthen any of the factions, which will lead to another split and factional wars. We don't need that. Let's wait for more stable times. \r\nConstitutional changes? \r\nIn the old constitution of the 1978 draft, the text contains a lot of revolutionary romance and names of the \"revolutionary committee\" style. But our revolution is already over and we would like a stable development in which revolutionary pathos and romance are not very appropriate. Maybe it's worth removing all this and replacing it with drier formulations? It is obvious that their preservation will demonstrate the preservation of the main power in the more left-wing radical factions. If they are removed, then both the party and the people will understand that we are talking about strengthening the reformists.\r\nLet's leave it. \r\nWe remove it.\r\nThe rejection of revolutionary phrases is the rejection of revolution! No changes to the people's constitution! \r\nWhy do we need phrases that lost relevance in the 40s? They are only needed by radicals to destabilize our society and legalize murder!\r\nNew Constitution\r\nIn the past, in 1978, we had a serious split in the party, and there was no unity between the factions at all. Now the situation is somewhat calmer and maybe it's worth working out our constitution better to make it more compromise? The conditionally left-wing project assumes the further construction of socialism according to the precepts of Mao, considering some of the changes that have occurred. Conventionally, the right is the reformist path, the turn to which Mao was condemned by the Soviet Union. \r\nAccept the project of the left.\r\nAccept the project of the right.\r\nWe don't need to change that. \r\nOur country is the birthplace of the revolution in Asia, and we cannot depart from the ideas of our ancestors who fought for our future! We proclaim the desire for socialism and prosperity through any measures, but even now our main task is the stability and high standard of living of our country.\r\nWe've had enough of this revolution! Let's become a calm power again, integrate into the world community and develop foreign trade and mutual prosperity! But, of course, we cannot allow the horrors of wild capitalism for our citizens, as in the USA, and therefore we must build a large system of social protection and support. \r\nThe question of forms of ownership \r\nAt the next party congress, the question of forms of ownership arose. The situation in the country has already stabilized, and we can begin reforms in this area. On the one hand, why change what works, besides, it will greatly damage stability. But we could carry out nationalization, which would entail the strengthening of left-wing factions and resources in the hands of the state, or vice versa - privatization, which would hit the support of the people hard...\r\nThere's no need to change.\r\nTo carry out nationalization and consolidate state ownership of the most important. \r\nCarry out privatization. \r\nWe have no need for reforms, and that's how everything works.\r\nNationalization was carried out, under which local entrepreneurs and even foreigners fell. This made it possible to attract huge funds to our economy, in particular, despite the sabotage by the former owners of private entrepreneurs. Suddenly, this caused the party's popularity to grow among the people, but made our country less attractive to businesses that do not see the inviolability of private property. \r\nFor stable development, we need privatization. Unprofitable state property was transferred to private hands through auctions. This made it possible to receive additional funds to the budget and remove the burden of the state from the production of some consumer goods. But it also led to higher prices, fraud in the market and an increase in the discontent of part of the population.\r\nNegotiations with Portugal\r\nToday our delegation will meet with the Portuguese one. The meeting is extremely important, and therefore we need to clearly work out our position in the negotiations. We can take a neutral position and calmly discuss small issues by signing banal documents. But maybe it's worth going further and concluding large-scale trade agreements? At the same time, some propose to put the question of Macau firmly...\r\nThere is no need to raise hot topics. \r\nWe will conclude trade agreements.\r\nLet's resolve the issue with Macau.\r\nNegotiations with Portugal took place today. No controversial issues were raised, a friendship agreement was concluded and the list of trade deals was expanded.\r\nDuring the negotiations with Portugal, a large-scale trade agreement was concluded, which actually made China the main trading partner of Portugal. Now a lot of foreign currency will flow into our budget, even if the United States is far from happy about losing control over another NATO country.\r\nThe Portuguese delegation was harshly confronted with the question of Macau. They were given to understand that nothing serious should be expected without the return of the city. It cannot be said that the entire delegation agreed, but nevertheless, the decision on the gradual return was signed by them...\r\n\"Tied hand and foot\" \r\nAt the regular plenum of the Central Committee, the question of regulating the activities of urban enterprises was raised. Allegedly, due to the constant interference of the state, the enterprises turned out to be \"Tied hand and foot\" and cannot function normally. But maybe the reason for the drop in efficiency, on the contrary, is their excessive freedom? The masses also believe that, on the contrary, they demand to finally deal with the petty bourgeoisie, that they refuse to adequately fulfill their duties, but at the same time they often violate the rights of hired workers.\r\nDo nothing.\r\nTighten regulation.\r\nDo not interfere in the future. \r\nThe question is devoid of any meaning. Everything works as it should, and excesses happen because of the stupidity of individual managers. Let's move on to more significant issues. \r\nPrivate owners were declared guilty, because it is they who, using their freedom, refuse to work for the good of the country. Therefore, it is necessary to throw off the least successful and integrate enterprises more firmly into the state.\r\nOf course, the state is guilty, which prevents business from developing! Restrictions should be lifted, and entrepreneurs should be allowed to solve the issues of their enterprises themselves! Let the people be dissatisfied with the price increase...\r\nExpansion of enterprises\r\nThe party was asked whether to allow enterprises to go beyond their sphere? Some military corporations may start producing civilian equipment. On the one hand, this will provide goods to sectors of the economy where everything is not good, but on the other hand, it may cause unhealthy competition with those who are already operating in unsuccessful sectors...\r\nLet's leave it as it is. \r\nLet's allow it. \r\nNo, there will only be more negative effects. Yes, we have sectors where existing enterprises cannot cope with providing the population with products. But it is important to understand that by letting in giants from other industries, those small ones that already operate in them will simply be strangled, and a monopoly will be established. And the expansion of activity will inevitably lead to a weakening of production for the main task...\r\nYes, it is worth allowing. Nevertheless, the needs of the people and the country are more important than the ideas of market competition. And soon the situation was stabilized, even if some enterprises were forced to close. \r\nForeign enterprises\r\nNot so long ago, the activities of foreign enterprises were allowed in our country, and now some party members want to change their conditions of activity. What should we do: follow the interests of our country and our people and greatly tighten the requirements for foreigners to respect the rights of workers, including working for the state, or go along with international capital for the sake of success in foreign policy and remove taxes from them altogether?\r\nJust tax it. \r\nTighten the requirements.\r\nExempt from taxes. \r\nThere is no need to scare off foreigners with strange demands. Just let them pay taxes and conduct their business as they see fit within the framework of the law.\r\nNo, the interests of our country are much more important than the desires of foreign corporations. Therefore, it is worth designating production regulations for them, setting high labor requirements for employees and the mandatory share of the state. \r\nIt is better that we have as many foreigners as possible! And therefore, we will even cancel their taxes for the next 20 years and no requirements for them are unacceptable! \r\nPatent Law \r\nOur industry is developing more and more, and therefore there are certain designs that were created by us. And anyway... If we enter the international patent system, we will also be able to make a profit from the fact that someone will apply their inventions in other countries. On the other hand, we will have to pay ourselves, since we produce a large amount of copied equipment...\r\nDon't sign.\r\nEnter the patent system. \r\nThe patent law will only harm us. Yes, once there, then we can wait for profits, but first we will pay huge sums for the \"stolen\" technologies. And what kind of property can there be on the idea, what nonsense!?\r\nThe PRC soon joined the world patent system. Of course, at first it caused a lot of conflicts, but already in the first year our inventions were applied abroad with understandable consequences. And the reputation has increased from this...\r\n\"Specialized farms\"\r\nDifferentiation or, to put it bluntly, stratification is beginning to be observed among the peasantry. Already, about 20% of farms can be attributed to wealthy citizens. Since most of them are associated with special branches of agriculture, the party decided to call such farms \"specialized\". And the party needs to decide what to do with this issue and whether it is necessary at all? \r\nLeave them, they won't be able to exploit others anyway.\r\nGive them tax breaks and give them the opportunity to hire workers and sell products abroad. \r\nConduct inspections and impose an increased tax. \r\nWell, there are and there are. The problem is not so big that it should be discussed so seriously. A high percentage of these farms shows that their existence is absolutely normal! These are honest people who have earned everything with their work. \r\nIt is important to understand that the owners of such farms are the future of our country. Hardworking, enterprising and skillful owners. They will support our agricultural business. They need help to protect them from the problems of wild competition and the attacks of other peasants. \r\nWe can see a new class stratification in the countryside. We need to drop the euphemism \"specialized farms\" and call them straight - fists. It is necessary to check them all and eliminate at least a third of them, and the rest should not be allowed to accumulate wealth so much. \r\nProblems of education \r\nOur country is in great need of advanced scientists, specialists and engineers. But decades of isolation could not but affect us and alarming reports are already being received about the critical lag of our science from the world. Of course, there are problems, but we should at least do something to close the gap.\r\nConclude an ordinary agreement on joint research and publish foreign scientific journals in PRC. \r\nCreate programs for sending students to study at foreign universities.\r\nInvite foreign teachers, scientists and engineers to join us.\r\nSoon the Academy of Sciences concluded a number of agreements with universities and research institutes of Western countries and the USSR. According to them, the most important scientific journals will be published, including on the territory of the People's Republic of China, thanks to which our scientists will be able to keep abreast of the trends of world science. Of course, it's not much, but at least something. \r\nAlready in September, our students went to study at foreign universities for the first time. Of course, before that they studied foreign languages intensively - English, Russian, Japanese, German and others. The result, of course, needs to wait for years, but students are extremely happy with this, even if there is a risk that students will return not only with knowledge, but also charged with capitalist propaganda. \r\nHuge funds have been invested in education and science, and a number of specialists from other countries have become interested in our international programs. It turned out that it was not so difficult to lure scientists and engineers from capitalist countries and the USSR with higher salaries and guarantees of stability. Of course, problems due to unusual life are still inevitable. But the result will be amazing! \r\nFormer capitalists \r\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, we still have many of those who used to be capitalists alive. The party needs to decide what to do with this category of citizens. On the one hand, the people see them as a danger and demand to maintain control over them, but on the other hand, a lot of time has passed and it is already possible to calm down, besides, such measures are not entirely humane...\r\nLeave them under supervision.\r\nLet's calm down and let them live.\r\nFormer capitalists are still a danger! It is foolish to forget how in the past they tried to organize counter-revolutionary organizations, cooperated with foreign intelligence services and organized rebellions. And the latest precedents were quite recently. They're too dangerous. \r\nDecades have passed. It is foolish to expect that most of the former bourgeoisie still have a past mindset. Now they are ordinary hardworking citizens. It's time to calm down about them.\r\nThe left wing of the Kuomintang \r\nToday, a delegation from the most revolutionary of the Kuomintang factions addressed our party. Their proposal is to establish relations between the CPC and their faction, as well as detente with the so-called Republic of China. What to do with them: can we make them our \"sleeping agents\" on the separatist island, defiantly refuse to support left-wing radicals, or even allow them in our country for the sake of moving towards true democracy? \r\nRecruit. \r\nTo condemn. \r\nLegalize their faction in the PRC.\r\nTheir offer was very tempting... And the factionists are aware of all the mistakes of the leadership of the past years and truly understand the meaning of Sun Yat-sen's ideas. They will make good \"our people\" in the ranks of the Taiwanese separatists. \r\nOf course, these Kuomintang people are much better than everyone else, but what's the point of all this? You do understand that they, under the guise of accepting our country, offer to actually recognize the separatists? Let them go back to where they came from! \r\nOf course, the Kuomintang had a lot of mistakes. But why not allow the activity of this cell? They still recognize socialism and our party. And they realize the mistakes of their ancestors. And the legalization of a good party will improve the situation in the country.\r\nOur compatriots abroad \r\nDue to decades of colonialism, devastation, civil war and poverty, many Chinese have fled to other countries. We are not talking about purely Chinese states, such as the Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macao. The party received a proposal to organize a program for their resettlement back to our country. But is it necessary? \r\nDo nothing. \r\nIssue a call to return. \r\nOrganize a repatriation program.\r\nOf course, broken families and peoples are bad. But the arrival of a huge number of people will not have such a good effect on the economy and living standards... Let's leave everything as it is.\r\nThe party issued a demonstrative statement calling for the Chinese to return to their homeland. Of course, some have returned, but those who have already taken place as citizens of other countries have remained in place. Still, just words are not enough. However, there was no need for more.\r\nThe program launched by the Government of the People's Republic of China for the return of ethnic Chinese to their homeland soon began work. Already in the first year, about a hundred thousand people have returned, and only a few million are expected to return. Yes, it will be difficult to provide everyone with housing and work, but our labor population will increase. Especially if we take into account that among the returning people there are citizens with special technical specialties who can be very useful to us. \r\nLocal autonomies \r\nThe party was asked to increase the local autonomy of the people's councils and other regional bodies. On the one hand, this may remove many problematic responsibilities from the party and increase the support of the people who have long wanted such reforms, but on the other hand, it threatens ungovernable regions...\r\nIncrease autonomy. \r\nLeave everything as it was.\r\nOur population is already sufficiently educated and will be able to cope with the issues. And you can always send special party members from the center to restore order. In general, the reform has been implemented. Even if a number of regions had to be dealt with because of the problems that they arranged, but in general the situation either has not changed, or even got better. The main thing is that the people are happy. \r\nWe don't need to reform. Not all regional entities will be able to adequately manage the country... And getting ungoverned regions that will sabotage national issues, thereby harming other parts of the country, is the worst we can get! \r\nThe question of citizenship \r\nAfter the changes in China, we should also change some provisions of our legislation. In particular, the law on citizenship, which was previously far from the most successful. But by what right will we introduce it?\r\nThe right of blood is citizenship for people of similar nationality. \r\nThe right of soil is citizenship for all those born in the territory of the PRC. \r\nBoth. \r\nOnly genetic Chinese can be citizens of the People's Republic of China! After all, our state is primarily a state of the Chinese and for the Chinese!\r\nAll those born on its territory can be considered citizens of the People's Republic of China. Still, do not forget about internationalism... and thanks to this, we will be able to bind foreign specialists to our country more firmly!\r\nCitizens of the People's Republic of China can become both those born on our territory, and in general all ethnic Chinese. Thus, without forgetting about internationalism and foreigners in our country, we actually get rights to all the territories where our people live. The separatists in Taiwan won't have long left! \r\nCommission on Human Rights \r\nAfter our country took its rightful place in the UN, there was a proposal to join the Commission on Human Rights. Of course, human rights are important, and we must protect them, but all these international bodies are mostly pro-Western ostentatious representations... We can simply join them and follow the path of rapprochement with the West, or we can defiantly refuse and thereby attract to us many countries that were victims of imperialist terror!\r\nRefuse with a pretentious speech. \r\nJoin. \r\nIn response to the proposals to join this commission, our delegation made a speech denouncing all these \"international\" commissions. Over the past 30 years, none of them has paid attention to the crimes of Western imperialists in Asia, in particular in Indochina. All of them only obey Western imperialism! We are for human rights, therefore we will not join these bodies! \r\nOf course, China should follow the path of international cooperation and preserve peace and stability. The PRC signs all human rights conventions and joins international organizations. Of course, it will not be so easy for us to follow their instructions... It will not be so easy to clean up the opposition... But the future will be calm! \r\nGender inequality\r\nIn an appeal to the party on behalf of Chinese women's organizations, serious problems of gender inequality were pointed out. In fact, everything is really very bad: starting from the fact that 70% of those without education in the country are women and ending with problems with employment and the preservation of archaic traditions. What should I do - close my eyes to the problem, because, according to some, it does not exist, or seriously start solving it?\r\nDo nothing. \r\nAdopt anti-discrimination laws.\r\nOf course, the problem of violation of women's rights is a very big threat to our society. This is how your speech before the party meeting began. Women's organizations, of course, are pleased that their problem has been noticed. But this is only temporary, because soon they will realize that there will be no other actions, because the party believes that other tasks are more important now. \r\nThe appeal of women's organizations was accepted by the party and considered seriously. And soon laws were passed on serious penalties for discrimination, quotas were established in educational institutions and enterprises, and in general, the topic of women's rights began to rise more and more often in public life. Of course, not everyone is happy with this and conservative-minded men have lost confidence in the government, and some of the foreign conservatives are already writing articles about the \"threat of the Chinese matriarchy\". But are we interested in the opinion of these obscurantists? \r\nMilitary draft \r\nThere was a proposal to change the service life in the PLA. But the question now is how long conscripts should serve. On the one hand, 1 year is not so much for training a soldier and it would be necessary more, but on the other hand, a service life of even 2-3 years will already hit the economy hard and slow down our development. And therefore, can the conscription service be canceled altogether?\r\nOnly a professional army. \r\nConscription for a year.\r\nConscription for 3 years. \r\nMilitarization of society. \r\nAs a result of the party discussions, it was decided to cancel conscription service in the army. Instead, for minimal military training, young people will be trained in educational institutions, and professional and well-trained military armed with advanced weapons and military equipment will defend the country.\r\nOf course, one year of military service will not be enough, as many of our military are already talking about. But we need to understand that our country is now more important than workers in industry and the civil sphere in general. And the army breaks down the youth a lot, after which many will not be able to integrate into ordinary life. \r\nOf course, three years of service will hit the country's economy hard, depriving it of labor. But industrialists will be forced to better address the problems of improving the quality of labor and automation. And over the years of service, you can make a professional soldier who will be ready for all the tasks and difficulties that may arise on the battlefield.\r\nIt is important to understand that our country is in a ring of hostile countries. In the north and west - Soviet revisionists, in the east - American puppets, in the south - India, dreaming of taking away our lands, and the independent regimes of Indochina. Our country needs protection, which can be provided only by the total mobilization of the whole society and the creation of a people's army on the model of the DPRK!\r\nDo we need shoulder straps? \r\nAfter the reform on conscription, a proposal was made to return shoulder straps to our army. Recall that they were previously abolished during the Cultural Revolution, as a bourgeois relic. But those days are over... Do we need shoulder straps, which are so demanded by many from the ranks of the army, even including the simplest soldiers? \r\nYes. \r\nNo. \r\nYes, shoulder straps are definitely needed. The times of revolutionary frenzy have already passed and it is important to understand that an army without a strict hierarchy is an army of partisans, but not a developed huge country. And what does the bourgeoisie have to do with it if the proletarians sew and wear them? \r\nNo, shoulder straps are by no means necessary. One thing is the rank system, another thing is shoulder straps. A symbol of imperialism and bourgeois armies. They have no place in our country of the proletarian dictatorship!\r\nCivilians in elected positions in army councils\r\nSome democratically-minded party members made a proposal to allow persons who are not directly military personnel, but are associated with the army, to be elected to the soviets under the army. On the one hand, this will solve a lot of problems that ordinary soldiers are not aware of - problems of soldiers' families, problems of the military-industrial complex, logistics problems. But on the other hand, it will cause obvious discontent of the army. Do we need such reforms?\r\nNo, these are councils for soldiers.\r\nYes, let them elect and be elected. \r\nOf course, the opinion of these citizens is very important, but do not forget that the councils of soldiers solve military issues. The rest are decided in other bodies: employees of the military-industrial complex can speak in the councils of their enterprises, and members of soldiers' families - for example, in women's councils. And if we allow such elections in the army, then we will get nothing but the discontent of the soldiers with empty chatter.\r\nThe army is very important to us. But the army is not only weapons and soldiers. The army will not be able to exist without millions of people working to produce the most ordinary machine gun, not to mention more complex types of weapons. The army cannot exist without the families of soldiers, because not all are ardent patriots of our country. Without coordination of all issues related to the army in one council, we will have many problems that are almost impossible to solve otherwise. And in order to avoid idle chatter, you can simply forbid discussing issues not related to the army.\r\nUnderground City\r\nFor the past 10 years, a huge system of bunkers has been built near Beijing to shelter hundreds of thousands of people in the event of a nuclear war with the United States or the USSR. In recent years, the international situation can be improved, and therefore the question arises about the need for such a system of bunkers. Might it be worth transferring them to the subordination of civil authorities?\r\nWe need to expand the Beijing bunker and build similar facilities in other cities.\r\nThere are no resources for this. \r\nIt is worth leaving the bunker to the military but freezing senseless construction. \r\nIt is better to transfer the object to civilians.\r\nOf course, the world can calm down, but we must be ready for war. The Beijing bunker will be expanded, and similar systems will be built in all major cities. Our goal is to save tens of millions of people after a nuclear strike from the imperialists! \r\nThe bunker is needed. But further construction requires too many resources, and its necessity is somewhat doubtful. Therefore, let the bunker remain with the military, but there is almost no point in building it further.. \r\nThe bunker was handed over to the civilian authorities. Soon, small-scale enterprises, as well as various leisure establishments, opened in the most equipped premises. There are already talks about improving some of the premises for the construction of residential apartments in them. And of course, one of the best museums of our recent history will open soon! \r\nHijacking of the MiG-25\r\nNot so long ago, a Soviet defector successfully hijacked the newest interceptor of the MiG-25 model to Japan. And considering that our engineers are developing their own J-8 interceptor, studying the Soviet aircraft will help us a lot. Our agents in the USSR can persuade one of those dissatisfied with the system to fly to the territory of the PRC. But this will worsen relations with the USSR and is the plane worth the disclosure of our agents? \r\nOrganize a hijacking. \r\nWe are not far enough embedded. \r\nRelations with the USSR are more important.\r\nAt the Soviet airbase, 2 MiG-25 interceptors were lifted into the air at night, as the Soviet border was crossed by a Chinese aircraft. The unknown spy was soon pushed back into the space of China. But, returning to the airfield, one of the planes suddenly turned in the direction of the PRC and began to gain speed. A few minutes later, he was already in the space of China. The air defenses did not shoot down the defector, because they were warned, and, however, they were not capable. After landing, the pilot surrendered to the authorities. Relations with the USSR have suffered greatly, but the military will be able to make our planes much better. \r\nNo need to hijack a plane. This will disrupt relations with the USSR.\r\nFleet renewal\r\nThe newest multi-purpose fighter MiG-29 was adopted by the USSR. We are still very far from such technologies. Therefore, it would be useful for us to get this plane... But how? You can just buy a license, but our relations are not so strong that the USSR sold us the latest weapons. Therefore, maybe it's worth using an agency?\r\nHijacking an airplane. \r\nWe're not that strong. \r\nSteal the blueprints.\r\nWe're not that strong. \r\nBuy the plane. \r\nWe don't have any money. \r\nDo nothing. \r\nOne of the Soviet pilots sympathizing with the CCP escaped to China on a MiG-29 fighter jet. Of course, relations with the USSR suffered, but we got the newest combat aircraft.\r\nA group of Chinese agents stole drawings of the newest MiG-29 aircraft from one of the Soviet factories. Relations with the USSR did not suffer. How would they know? But our Air Force will receive the newest aircraft.\r\nThe Chinese delegation visited the USSR. And along with a lot of minor issues, it was decided to purchase the latest MiG-29 fighters. In fact, this is the first Soviet military equipment that we have received since the 1950s. But of course, this is just a base for our own developments.\r\nOther problems are more important. \r\nCosmodromes\r\nAt the moment, our country has the only cosmodrome - the Jiuquan complex. There are proposals from scientists and the military to build new spaceports. And our country is lucky - we already have 2 ready-made projects: the completion of the Taiyuan military missile base for space launches and the restoration of the construction of the Xichang cosmodrome, which was discontinued in 1972. However, there may be enough resources for both projects... . \r\nRestore Xichang.\r\nThere are no resources for this.\r\nComplete Taiyuan.\r\nBuild both projects.\r\nThere are no resources for everything.\r\nThe complex in Xichang was restored, now our country will be able to make more space launches. In addition, the scientists who supervised this site used part of the budget for other developments. \r\nThe Taiyuan base was completed for space launches, now our country will be able to make more space launches. In addition, the military who supervised this site used part of the budget for other developments.\r\nBoth space centers were built, and therefore the number of launches will be a record for our country! \r\nOur country has other problems besides the huge costs of space! \r\nNew launch vehicles \r\nAll this time, our space program has been \"pulled\" by the already outdated Changzheng-1 and Fengbao-1 rockets. The engineers of the space agency have actually already prepared a deep modification of the latter, which will be called Changzheng-2. And it remains only to send it to production. But there are proposals for the further development of the family. For example, engineers propose the concepts of the Changzheng-4 light rocket and the Changzheng-3 medium rocket, which allows launching satellites into geostationary orbit. There is a risky heavy rocket project, but isn't it too complicated for us now? \r\nStart developing Changzheng 3 and 4.\r\nThere are no resources for this. \r\nStart developing all projects.\r\nMoreover, there are no resources. \r\nSend only Changzheng-2 to the series. \r\nThe country needs the ability to launch not only into low Earth orbit. And soon we will have access to both large masses and new classes of payloads and orbits! \r\nThe world was amazed by our latest developments. It would seem that until recently China was a third world country, and now it has successfully launched a heavy rocket capable of carrying more than 20 tons of load into space. China will have a great space future! \r\nWe have other problems besides developing projects for new missiles. And Changzheng-2 is quite enough for all loads. Both military and civilian.\r\nSpace communication \r\nOur country is entering a new era that will make satellite communications available not only for military needs. There is a proposal to make a system of communication satellites in low Earth orbit, but this will require a large number of little-used satellites, and launching geostationary satellites requires a special rocket... On the other hand, we can connect to someone's network that already exists. \r\nCreate a network in a low reference orbit. \r\nThere are no resources for this. \r\nLaunch geostationary satellites. \r\nThere are no such technologies. \r\nConnect to someone else's network. \r\nSoon, China deployed its system of many satellites orbiting in low Earth orbit. Of course, this is not the best option, but it will allow us to fulfill our tasks.\r\nOur country became the fourth in the world to launch a satellite into geostationary orbit on its own. Soon, literally several satellites covered the entire territory of China with fast and high-quality communications.\r\nUnfortunately, our technologies will not allow us to create communication satellites ourselves, therefore it is better to connect to someone else's network. \r\nNavigation satellite network\r\nMore than a year ago, the United States began creating its own satellite global positioning system - GPS. Intelligence also reports that in the coming years, the USSR will begin implementing a similar project. Against the background of these events, a proposal was received to create its own, Chinese, system. Of course, this will require resources, but the return will be enormous...\r\nStart Beidou system launches!\r\nThere are no resources for this. \r\nSuch a system is not a priority. Maybe in 10 years the time will come.\r\nSoon the first satellite of China's own navigation satellite system was launched. Thus, our country became the second to deploy such a system, overtaking the USSR, which previously surpassed us in technology.\r\nThe deployment of this system was considered too expensive and risky, and therefore it was postponed for a couple of five-year plans.\r\nManned space program\r\nThe USSR and the USA have already launched their cosmonauts into Earth orbit and even further. China, of course, is catching up, but still a space power, which means we must repeat this achievement. At least that's what scientists want. And it will help your political reputation. And there are 2 proposals here - to convert FSW's own returnable satellites into single manned capsules, or with the help of intelligence to obtain documentation on Soviet Soyuz ships in order to create your own ship of a similar class on its basis. Or you can cancel the program again...\r\nRemake your own satellites. \r\nIt's too dangerous. And useless.\r\nCreate based on the \"Soyuz\".\r\nIt's too risky an operation. And our technologies will not allow us to make an analog. \r\nCancel the program again. \r\nIn total, it was decided to make manned versions of FSW satellites. Of course, there will be no more benefit from such flights than from Gagarin's flight, and there is no need to talk about a serious program based on such capsules at all, but still this is the first step on the way to space!\r\nIt was difficult to repeat the \"Union\". And in some places, it had to be replaced, in other places engineers came up with improvements. That's how \"Shenzhou\" appeared. The propaganda success of the flight was enormous - a third world country was able to create a modern multi-seat spacecraft that even surpassed the Soviet \"prototype\". But it hit relations with the USSR. \r\nThe manned space program is hopeless. Repeat the \" Soyuz \" will not work. And a single capsule is of no use. There are other tasks. \r\nFurther development of the manned program \r\nNot so long ago, the first Chinese cosmonaut was successfully launched on a ship of his own design. But it is obvious to everyone that the functionality and prospects of such a ship are extremely small. Therefore, scientists believe that it is worth starting the development of a more advanced multi-seat ship of the type of the Soviet \"Union\". But our resources are limited.\r\nStart development. \r\nThere are no resources for this. \r\nA man in space is enough.\r\nThe development was started and a few years later the first Chinese crew of several people flew into space. The world was surprised by our achievements, and many scientific and technological prospects opened up for our country. \r\nThe benefits of more advanced ships will be negligible to deal with them seriously. This was the conclusion of engineers and scientists on the proposal to develop an analogue of the Soviet \"Union\". China should focus on unmanned vehicles. \r\nLunar program - the first apparatuses \r\nScientists have proposed a project of our own program for the study of the only natural satellite of the Earth. The first stage consists of simple devices for exploring the Moon from flight paths and, possibly, a landing station. Actually, it's all the problems - the project is too complicated for us and may turn out to be a failure. Do I need to start implementing?\r\nLaunch the landing station, too. \r\nIt's too complicated. \r\nLaunch only flying vehicles.\r\nChina's success in space research has not gone unnoticed. Against the background of the absence of any missions to the Moon over the past 5 years, our landing mission was to some extent a shock to the world of cosmonautics. And while the rest of the world is admiring, China is starting a new stage of the lunar program. \r\nChina's lunar program consisted of launching a flight and orbital mission to the moon, which carried out photography and a number of scientific measurements. It became a sensation except for developing countries. But due to the complexity and meaninglessness, the program was closed in China itself. \r\nChina's Lunar Program - Advanced Missions \r\nAfter the successful landing of our probe on the surface of the Moon, scientists proposed 2 more important missions to explore our satellite - an improved version of the landing platform carrying a small lunar rover, and a station for automatic delivery of lunar soil samples. And if the first project is quite feasible, then there are difficulties with the second one again. In fact, this was carried out only by the USSR, and even there almost half of the devices were failures. The risk of an accident is high, because the second mission is still in question... \r\nLaunch both missions. \r\nIt's too risky. \r\nLaunch only the lunar rover. \r\nThe successes of China's lunar program continue to amaze the world community - China has become the second country after the USSR that was able to create a lunar rover and carry out automatic delivery of lunar soil. And while everyone is speculating about China's technology, the third stage of our lunar program is coming. \r\nThe successes of China's lunar program continue to amaze the world community - China has become the second country after the USSR that was able to create a lunar rover. But, unfortunately, the complexity of further projects forces us to stop the program.\r\nLunar Program - people on the Moon \r\nThe final stage of the space program was obvious to everyone - the landing of Chinese cosmonauts on the surface of the Moon. But, as the US space program has shown, this is more a political action, and there will be almost no scientific benefit. So do we need it now or is it better to continue developing more long-term plans for the lunar station? \r\nWe are going to the moon by the end of the 1980s!\r\nA man on the moon is not needed. \r\nWe are betting on a long-range project.\r\nAs a result, the project of landing on the moon until 1990 was adopted. Industrial and scientific enterprises have moved into an extremely busy work schedule. But many doubt the need for this as such...\r\nthe landing of a person as soon as possible was recognized as unpromising. Instead, engineers and scientists were tasked with developing a long-term settlement on the surface of the moon by the 2030s.\r\nMissions to Venus \r\nDue to the sufficient development of our technologies, the question of a flight to Venus arises. And there are 2 mission projects here - a simple orbital station or an orbital station in combination with a lander. The implementation of the last project will obviously be much more difficult, but there will also be more scientific data...\r\nThe orbital station. \r\nIt's too risky. \r\nThe lander. \r\nIt's too risky.\r\nRejection of the flight program to Venus. \r\nThe PRC sent an orbiter to Venus, becoming the third country that could do such a thing. The station made a huge contribution to science, because by combining its data with the research of Soviet spacecraft, it was possible to create the first complete map of Venus.\r\nThe PRC sent an orbital and landing craft to Venus, becoming the third country that could do such a thing. The station made a huge contribution to science, because by combining its data with the research of Soviet spacecraft, it was possible to create the first complete map of Venus, and the photos from the surface were the highest quality of all. \r\nIt was decided to abandon the project of the flight to Venus because of the complexity \r\nThe first missions to Mars \r\nChina may well carry out a mission to Mars. The question is, will it be just a landing mission, or will we decide to create something that no one has tried before - a rover. Of course, this is a high complexity, but also an incredible benefit for science! \r\nJust a landing station. \r\nThere are no resources for this either. \r\nThe Mars rover. \r\nToo risky. \r\nCancel the flight to Mars. \r\nChina has successfully launched a lander to Mars. Thus, we became the third country that was able to land on the surface of the red planet and the second whose module remained operational at the same time. Scientists already foresee huge amounts of useful information.\r\nChina has successfully launched a rover. In fact, such projects had not been implemented before, and therefore the prestige of the PRC space agency has grown incredibly in the eyes of the world community. And the rover continues its journey across Mars, collecting the necessary information about the planet. \r\nThe flight to Mars is too risky, and therefore it is better to abandon it.\r\nOrbital station\r\nOur manned program has almost come close to a new stage - the creation of an orbital manned station. Yes, the project is quite complex, but the USSR had a successful experience in creating stations of the DOS series. And there are already proposals to combine our station with the Soviet Mir, which is being prepared for launch. And the creation of the first international space station will significantly bring our countries closer together! \r\nCreate your own station. \r\nIt's too complicated.\r\nWe need a joint project of the PRC and the USSR.\r\nThere can be no cooperation with them.\r\nWe don't need a station. \r\nSoon the first Chinese manned orbital observatory was launched. Yes, the first crew faced a number of difficulties, but with this step we opened a new stage of our space program with incredible prospects! \r\nBy agreement, the first international space station \"Dawn\" was created. The joint work of the Chinese and Soviet crews is already yielding significant scientific results, and the impact of the project on international relations is invaluable. A number of countries allied to the USSR and the PRC have already expressed a desire to participate in the work of the station, and our design bureaus are already developing plans for further expansion of the station.\r\nManned space stations require incredible resources, and there is virtually no practical benefit from them. We have more important tasks. \r\nThe space aircraft program \r\nThe opportunities that the Space Shuttle program has opened for the United States are of interest to our military and scientists. Space planes will allow increasing the number of launches and carrying out work with satellites in orbit. And here we are offered 2 projects - a light device that we can create literally in the next year, or a heavy one, completely similar to the American one, but it will take more time and resources to create. And there are critics of the program, which point to the complexity and uselessness of the program's prospects...\r\nCreate a small device.\r\nThere are no resources for this. \r\nCreate a heavy machine. \r\nThere are no resources for this project either. \r\nAbandon the project.\r\nSoon, the PRC launched its small space plane, overtaking the USSR in this. However, soon the management was disappointed - there was very little practical benefit from the device, and he would never be able to recoup the costs invested in it. Therefore, the space aircraft program was soon closed. \r\nChina decided to create a full-fledged analogue of the American Shuttle and the Soviet Buran. Of course, the project will be completed in a few years at best, but it can really be useful, unlike the light vehicle project.\r\nIt was decided to abandon the development of space aircraft. There are other, more important tasks in space. \r\nNuclear Apocalypse \r\nBecause of the rash decisions of your leadership, the world died in a nuclear war. In response to the Chinese strikes on Vietnam, the United States and the USSR dropped nuclear missiles on our cities. Of course, the PRC could not adequately respond and only some Siberian and Central Asian cities of the Union were destroyed. But after our defeat, the USA and the USSR have already entered into a conflict between them, as a result of which Antarctica remained the only continent on which there were no zones infected with radioactive materials. Humanity will roll back in its progress to the level of the 19th century. \r\nPeaceful settlement\r\nDespite the reckless nuclear strike on Vietnam, China was able to avoid nuclear annihilation. Of course, there was nothing left without consequences, and the country was severely limited in many ways, from which development was slowed down.\r\nRed rising sun \r\nThanks to the active Chinese intervention in Japan, the pro-Chinese wing of the communists, Sanzo Nosaka, came to power, abolished the monarchy and sent monastic persons to be re-educated into ordinary citizens, as well as banned right-wing parties and declared adherence to the principles of \"democracy of the left parties.\" Soon, with the help of the PRC and its own unique labor discipline, the country became one of the leaders of the world economy, despite its small size. Thanks to high technology, it was Japan that became the first country with a fully robotic economy and, probably, Japanese society will be the first society to step into communism. However, as long as the tense relations between Japan and Moscow remain, because the KP I was ready to recognize our territorial claims, but considers the Kuriles aggressively selected by the Kremlin...\r\nFascists are in power again \r\nThanks to the active Chinese intervention, Japanese militarists carried out a military coup and established an \"umbrella\" dictatorship praising the imperial past: a coalition of Issui-Kai (anti-American ultra-rightists who do not support militarism), Nippon Seinensya (radical pro-monarchist Shintoists), Seiki-juku (a pro-monarchist movement affiliated with criminal syndicates) and Yukoku Doshikai (extreme right-wing terrorist militaristic organization). Corporatism and military spirit were restored in the country, and criminal syndicates were legalized. And if at first the new regime was still cooperating with China out of desperation, recently it has been trying to become more independent and more aggressive. Unfortunately, we may have set the stage for a new war already in the 21st century... \r\nChinese on the Moon\r\nIn the late 1980s, our country managed to land people on the moon, repeating the feat of American cosmonautics 20 years ago. But, unfortunately, the success of the program and the focus on the landing and installation of the flag led to the fact that there were no prospects for lunar landings. By the end of the 90s, about 10 missions were completed, the last of which were already purely propaganda in nature, expressed, for example, in flights of international crews with cosmonauts from countries allied to China. But it was not possible to achieve more.\r\nInternational Lunar Station \r\nThe bet on the long lunar program has paid off. Methodically studying the Moon and working out the project of the base on the Earth's satellite, our scientists were able to create a concept that allows us to fully use all the opportunities that open up. International cooperation will reduce the cost of this base for our country and will allow us to take the first step towards international space. A superheavy launch vehicle for launching modules and equipment is already being created. And the first launches are planned for the mid-2000s. And most likely, the program will succeed.\r\nReturn of Martian soil samples \r\nAfter a number of successful missions to Mars, the leadership of the Chinese space agency decided to launch an unprecedented mission to take soil from the red planet and return it to Earth. The launch took place in 1992 and by the end of the decade a capsule with soil samples from the planet was successfully returned. Due to the fact that such samples were the first to be delivered by China, the country's reputation in the world scientific community has increased and many have begun to cooperate with our scientists. The next step, of course, is the landing of a man on Mars, but these are certainly not plans for the next 20 years...\r\nInternational Space Station\r\nThe joint station of the USSR and the PRC gave rise to a major international space project that made it possible to ensure a permanent human presence in Earth orbit. Soon the station of 2 modules was supplemented by both the USSR and China. And by the end of the 90s, even the USA and Europe had created their own segments at the station. This and other projects of our countries will ensure the internationalist nature of cosmonautics! \r\nNuclear conflict\r\nNothing happened.\r\nJapanese Rhapsody\r\nNothing happened.\r\nLunar expedition\r\nNothing happened.\r\nDistant Red Mars\r\nNothing happened.\r\nA station in space\r\nNothing happened.\r\nThe Kampuchea-Vietnam War\r\nProblems of Genghis Khan's heirs\r\nAtaturk's legacy\r\nComrade Chairman!

On the other hand, by supporting <color=#0027FF>Harri Holkeri</color>, we will be able to get a profitable trade contract from the new government.{0}And if you think about it, what do we care about such a distant Finland?\r\nWe will support the SDPF and Mauno Koivisto\r\nChina is not in the CMEA...\r\nWe cannot support revisionism...\r\nChina's global influence should be above 30.0...\r\nAgents must be above 10.0...\r\nMoney must be above 10.0...\r\nChina's global influence should be above 15.0...\r\nLet's help the right-wing Democrats\r\nRelations with the USSR must not be restored...\r\nDo not interfere\r\nWe launched a full-scale campaign to support the SPDF in the presidential elections, providing financial assistance to the party (and not only financial). Now campaign posters <color=#006400>Koivisto</color> and Social Democrats everywhere, and mass discrediting of the National Coalition began on television, the leader of <color=#0027FF>Harri Holkeri</color> was accused of large-scale corruption while working on the board of directors of the Bank of Finland. Under the pressure of popular anger, he had to withdraw his candidacy.{0}In the elections <color=#006400>Mauno Koivisto</color> easily beat the former prime minister of the centrist government Johannes Virolainen and scored 71%. {0}The first action as president was the dissolution of the right-liberal parliament and the organization of new elections. Thanks to our financial support and the creation of a united coalition of Social Democrats, Communists and green environmentalists, the left was able to gain a record 67% and received a constitutional majority.{0}In gratitude to us for the victory, the first thing the newly elected parliament decided on Finland's accession to the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance.\r\nBy hook or by crook, we were able to drag the unpopular National Democrat <color=#0027FF>Harry Holkeri</color> to the post of President of Finland with hard efforts. Thanks to the brilliant work of our special services, the Communist candidate from the FNDL was found dead at home. According to experts, the cause of death was the administration of poison. Centrist leader and ex-Prime Minister Johannes Virolainen was killed by a sniper shot during an election speech in Oulu, the killer was not found. The seriously strengthened \"National Coalition\" began to discredit the Social Democrats, calling them Kremlin puppets who want to destroy the identity of Finland and make it a \"prison of the Finnish people.\"{0}In the elections with a margin of 4% <color=#0027FF>Harry Holkeri</color> was able to overtake the Social Democrat and scored 38%. First of all, the new government took a course to the West, declaring the USSR in imperial ambitions to enslave Finland and create a \"communist colony\". Not forgetting our help, we were offered a very lucrative contract.\r\n<color=#006400>The SDPF and Mauno Koivisto</color> won a landslide victory, gaining 43% of the votes, while the closest rival scored only 18%. The new Government announced deep socio-economic reforms and support for vulnerable segments of the population. It was also announced to continue the course of cooperation with the USSR and the socialist camp. However, we don't care about that.\r\nOrganize a democratic underground against the junta ({0}: - 25.0, {1}: - 15.0, {2}: - 20.0)\r\nBudget\r\nAgents\r\nArmy\r\nThe underground is too weak!\r\nTurkish Civil War\r\nMilitary\r\nUnderground\r\nEstablish contacts between the junta and the far right ({0}: - 25.0, {1}: - 15.0)\r\nIgnore\r\nRecognize the junta\r\nDo not recognize the junta\r\nThanks to the active work of our intelligence networks with democratic underground organizations in Turkey, we managed to supply them with weapons and prepare a number of local uprisings throughout Turkey. Despite the point and fragmentation of the movement, the rebels are a fairly cohesive force that causes serious damage to the troops of the junta.{0}Nevertheless, the country is gradually sliding into the abyss of civil war...\r\nThanks to the active work of our intelligence networks with far-right movements in Turkey, we managed to \"correct\" all the flaws in the program of <color=#FF4500>National Movement Party</color> and <color=#FF4500>Gray Wolves</color>, thereby, to allow it to collude with the junta by getting its representatives into the government.{0}By joint efforts, they expanded the persecution of communists, democrats, left-wing writers and dissidents, representatives of national minorities - \"death camps\" were created throughout the country, and extrajudicial killings and \"black lists\" have become common practice.{0}The world community has generally condemned the military coup.\r\nThe world community generally condemned the military coup, but we decided to ignore it.\r\nWe supported the military coup. China's Foreign Minister called this event \"the only possible way to resolve the issue of preserving the integrity and national sovereignty of the country.\" The world community generally condemned the military coup.\r\nWe did not support the military coup. China's Foreign Minister called the event a \"reactionary anti-constitutional coup.\" The world community generally condemned the military coup.\r\nArmy strength should be greater than {0}...\r\nTurkish Civil War\r\nGovernment\r\nUnderground\r\nAs a result of the Turkish Civil War, the government of the <color=#2F4F4F>National Security Council</color> managed to stop the rebels' attempts to challenge the power of the military.{0}Now the Junta is preparing for a new round of repression against ultra-left and ultra-right organizations, but after the civil war, wait for an ambulance the transfer of power into the hands of civilian rule is not worth it.\r\nAs a result of the Turkish Civil War, the government of the <color=#2F4F4F>National Security Council</color> fell under the onslaught of the rebels, who managed to establish contacts with some of the generals and officers, and in exchange for an amnesty, they agreed to a peaceful transfer of power.{0}At the elections held after the elections, <color=#8B0000>Workers' Party of Turkey</color> and <color=#006400>People's Republican Party</color> received an approximately equal number of votes, as a result of which they had to agree to an agreement and organize a coalition the government headed by the Social Democrat Bulent Ecevit.{0}Because of the US support for the Junta, the new government announced a program to phase out contacts with the North Atlantic Alliance.\r\nThe officers, realizing the senselessness of the bloodshed of the civil war, revolted against the government of the junta and declared it overthrown. Leaders of the regime and members of the <color=#2F4F4F>National Security Council</color> were tried for crimes against humanity and a coup d'état.{0}The Kemalist <color=#006400>People's Republican Party</color> won the early elections, and the government was headed by the Social Democrat Bulent Ecevit. \r\nArabian night\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the growing economic crisis, the political crisis in Syria has also aggravated, which is exacerbated by the undemocratic and clannish nature of the Syrian government.{0}There are two figures on the scales of the conflict - the current president <color=#006400>Hafez al-Assad</color>, who came to power in 1970 as a result of a coup d'état. During a decade of high prices, despite a general rise in the standard of living of the population, the al-Assad government failed to modernize the country, and by the early 1980s, problems with food supplies and smuggling worsened in the country.{0}In addition, for a number of years a conflict is brewing between Hafez and the army, which, ironically, is led by his brother - <color=#0027FF>Rifat al-Assad</color>, who has the advantage of the so-called. \"defence companies\" - privileged military units numbering over 50 thousand people. According to our intelligence, <color=#0027FF>Rifat al-Assad</color> does not accept the current position of Syria in the Iran-Iraq and Lebanese conflicts. He, as we know, has some contacts with Saudi Arabia and advocates a more pro-Western foreign policy. He also actively supported entrepreneurs and merchants who demanded an expansion of the scope of \"liberalization\", while trying to enlist the support of the wider public. {0}In any case, this will be a good chance for us to drive Syria and the Middle East out of Soviet influence. In addition, according to various sources, <color=#006400>Hafez Assad</color> is now ill and an acute succession crisis may arise in the country. \r\nSupport Hafez al-Assad and send aid to Syria ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 5.0)\r\nHelp Rifat Assad organize a coup ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 15.0)\r\nIgnore\r\nChina's global influence should be higher than {0}...\r\nWe sent serious economic aid to Syria, which allowed us to organize a pro-Chinese lobby in the highest power elites. <color=#006400>Hafez al-Assad</color>, who until then outwardly remained loyal to the Soviet leadership because of preferential loans, began to look more closely at China.{0}The dynastic conflict, in turn, was resolved harshly and uncompromisingly - the pro-presidential Republican Guard disarmed the \"defense brigades\" <color=#0027FF>Rifat al-Assad</color>, and the president's brother, who was also considered a \"symbol of corruption\" by the public, was sent to trial for attempted rebellion.\r\nWe managed to prepare a successful conspiracy against the current President of Syria <color=#006400>Hafez al-Assad</color>.{0}Enlisting the loyalty of elites dissatisfied with politics\r\nThe plot has failed! President <color=#006400>Hafez al-Assad</color>, apparently (possibly Soviet advisers), was informed about the preparation of a conspiracy by <color=#0027FF>Rifat al-Assad</color>. The latter was arrested and expelled from the country, and the \"defense brigades\" were disbanded.{0}Previously more cautious in his foreign policy, <color=#006400>Hafez al-Assad</color> moved closer to the USSR.\r\nAn attempt at conspiracy by <color=#0027FF>Rifat al-Assad</color> failed. After short political conflicts and agitation against the backdrop of the president's illness, <color=#0027FF>Rifat al-Assad</color> was forced to leave Syria, giving up all government posts.{0}<color=#006400>Hafez al-Assad</color>, in turn, withdrew Syrian troops from Lebanon and began a series of reforms aimed at liberalizing and improving the country's economy.\r\nAgain?\r\nThe ultra-nationalist government of Turkey, formed from members of the military junta and the pro-fascist <color=#FF4500>National Movement Party</color>, has taken the path of subjugating national minorities. Since the late 1970s, <color=#8B0000>Kurdish Workers' Party</color> has been fighting for national liberation, but after the coup, its paramilitary wing had to hide in the mountains, retreating to the Syrian and Iraqi borders.{0}Recently, the Junta government adopted Turkey's new constitution, which included overtly nationalist provisions. For example, it is recognized that «the Turkish state, its territory and nation are a single indivisible whole», any language other than the state language is prohibited. The Government also introduced discriminatory measures against the Kurds - it was forbidden to give newborn children Kurdish names, and the population of the border groups was forbidden to own livestock.{0}The southeastern regions are of strategic importance for Turkey, their loss would mean deprivation of control over the water resources of the Tigris and Euphrates, and, accordingly, a lever of pressure on Iraq and Syria, which need Turkish fresh water.{0}In order to curb the Kurdish nationalists, the Junta sent troops to the region, where they massacred the local population. The actions of the authorities in many countries are characterized as genocide. These events have already caused a migration crisis - refugees are fleeing to Syria and Iraq. The Turkish military is using anti-human tactics, taking the local population hostage and forcing parts of the partisans to surrender.{0}Obviously, a serious regional crisis is brewing, which could lead to a general aggravation of the situation in the world, what should we do?\r\nTogether with the USSR, push the UN to recognize Turkish nationalism as a form of racism.\r\nArm the Kurds and send military assistance ({0}: - 25.0, {1}: - 15.0, {2}: - 30.0)\r\nOne nation less...\r\nImpose economic sanctions on Turkey.\r\nThere is no springboard for helping the Kurds...\r\nRelations with the USSR have not been restored...\r\nBy a majority vote, the UN adopted a resolution proposed by the Soviet Union and China recognizing Turkish nationalism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. All the socialist and Arab countries voted \"FOR\" the adoption, \"AGAINST\" - the Western countries. {0}Thus, Turkish nationalism was equated with apartheid and Zionism, many countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe severed relations with the aggressor.\r\nBy a majority vote, the UN refused to accept a resolution proposed by the Soviet Union and China recognizing Turkish nationalism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. Despite the fact that all the countries of the Eastern Bloc voted \"Yes\", the Arab countries decided to abstain. \r\nThe Kurdish national liberation forces, located on the border with Turkey, crossed the frontier and invaded the territory of Turkish Kurdistan, successfully knocking out government troops. However, reinforcements are expected and it is not yet very clear how long the Kurdish guerrillas can withstand. \r\nThe junta continued its policy of deportations and genocide, despite all the pressure from the world community. Government Leader <color=#2F4F4F>K. Evren</color> stated that \"the operation will last until the last Kurdish terrorist falls\". \r\nWe have unilaterally severed any trade and diplomatic ties with the Junta.{0}The Junta, however, continued its policy of deportations and genocide, despite all the pressure from the world community. Government Leader <color=#2F4F4F>K. Evren</color> stated that \"the operation will last until the last Kurdish terrorist falls\".\r\nTurkish-Kurdish War\r\nGovernment\r\nKurds\r\nThe result of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict was the complete destruction of the forces <color=#8B0000>Kurdistan Workers' Party</color>. Most of the unfinished guerrillas moved to neighboring countries, and the refugee crisis caused by the war seriously hit the economies of Arab countries, where these refugees were mainly heading. \r\nThe result of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict was the retreat of government troops under the onslaught of partisan detachments <color=#8B0000>Kurdistan Workers' Party</color>. As a result, the southeastern regions of Turkey, where Kurds live, proclaimed the creation of a Kurdish Democratic Republic. <color=#8B0000>The Kurdistan Workers' Party</color> formed a one-party government of the republic, which was headed by the leader of the party <color=#8B0000>Abdullah Ocalan</color>.{0}After such a defeat, the Turkish junta was deposed, and power passed to civilian rule.{0}Kemalist party won the early elections <color=#006400>The Republican People's Party</color>, and the government was headed by the Social Democrat Bulent Ejevit.\r\nThe officers, realizing the senselessness of the bloodshed of the civil war, rebelled against the junta government and declared it deposed. Over the mode leaders and members <color=#2F4F4F>The National Security Council</color> was tried for crimes against humanity and a coup d'etat.{0}Kemalist party won the early elections <color=#006400>The Republican People's Party</color>, and the government was headed by the Social Democrat Bulent Ejevit.{0}<color=#8B0000>The Kurdistan Workers' Party</color> was legalized by the new authorities, and the Kurdish regions of Turkey received national autonomy. \r\nGenocide for export\r\nAn event of extreme importance! This week, explosions thundered in all major Turkish cities, for example, more than 30 people were killed and dozens more injured due to a terrorist attack at Ankara airport.{0}Government <color=#2F4F4F>The National Security Council</color> announced that was responsible for the events that occurredThe <color=#8B0000>Kurdistan Workers' Party</color>, which, despite the defeat of the movement inside the country, allegedly continues to be funded by neighboring countries to destabilize the situation in Turkey.{0}Government leader <color=#2F4F4F>K.

According to the operation plan, the USSR should send troops to Turkey from the Caucasus, and NATO - from Greece. {0}Turkey in response to this announced its withdrawal from NATO. \r\nThe US and the USSR vetoed China's initiative to conduct a peacekeeping operation.\r\nThe cooperation agreement with the United States has not been signed...\r\nCooperation with the CIA is not established...\r\nThe state structure is not unitary...\r\nNothing threatens the integrity of the state!\r\nDiplomatic reputation should be below \"Conservative\"...\r\nTurkish-Syrian War\r\nTurkey \r\nSyria\r\nTurkish-Iraqi War\r\nIraq\r\nTurkish-Iranian War\r\nIran\r\nSyria\r\nIraq,\r\niran,\r\nIraq and Iran, which are in conflict with each other, have declared a truce.\r\nThe attacked country has already turned to the world community for help.\r\nThe attacked countries have already turned to the world community for help.\r\nattacked country\r\nattacked countries\r\nUyghuristan\r\nTibet\r\nTibet and Uyghurstan\r\nGreece should be in NATO...\r\nTurkey managed to sweep away the Damascus regime and establish puppet rule in the country by the <color=#8B4513>National Party of Syria</color>\r\nThe Syrian troops successfully managed to drive the Turkish aggressors out their territory.\r\nTurkey succeeded in overthrowing the Baghdad regime and establishing puppet rule in the country by the <color=#8B4513>National Party of Iraq</color>\r\nIraqi troops successfully managed to drive the Turkish aggressors out of their territory.\r\nTurkey succeeded in overthrowing the Tehran regime and establishing puppet rule in the country by the <color=#8B4513>National Party of Iran</color>\r\nIranian troops successfully managed to drive the Turkish aggressors out of their territory.\r\nRevanche?\r\nAfter the defeat of Israel in the Lebanon War, the situation has not changed much. Negotiations between the PLO and Israel did not take place, the conflict between Muslims and Christians did not end, and the Syrian presence in Lebanon did not allow peace to be achieved in the region.{0}Against the background of recent events, Israel, angered by its recent defeat, again tried to invade Lebanon under the pretext of fighting terrorism. How will the situation develop this time, given that Syria is mired in a conflict with Turkey?\r\nWar is hell\r\nHope this all ends soon...\r\nSecond Lebanese War\r\nIsrael\r\nLebanon\r\nIsrael managed to drive out the Syrian troops from the northern territory of Lebanon and form its puppet democratic government in the republic, headed by the right-wing Christian party <color=#8B4513>Kataib</color>. All Muslim and pro-Palestinian parties were banned. \r\nIsrael lost again - the Lebanese troops managed to hold out and drive the aggressor's troops out of Lebanese territory.{0}Numerous anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim rallies took place in Israel, which resulted in the legislative ban of several Arab and pacifist parties - <color=#8B0000>Hadash</color> and <color=#006400>Rach</color>. As a result, only pro-Israeli parties remained in the parliament.{0}On the wave of victory in Lebanon, new elections were held, in which the Lebanese National Salvation Front, an association of leftist and democratic parties, won. \r\nAfter several months of bloody battles, Israel pulled back the troops, declaring \"the objectives of the anti-terrorist operation\", but it is clear that the Israeli military machine has run out of resources to continue such a long war.\r\nNew Treaty of Sevres?\r\nAfter Turkey lost in {1}, the fate of the world began to depend directly on the situation in the Middle East.{0}Advisors offer the following options for resolving the situation. The first is the creation of an independent Kurdish state in order to solve the issue of separatism forever and let this people decide their own destiny. However, an obvious problem arises - within what boundaries and where? The Kurdish people are spread over the territories of four Middle Eastern states, and it is obvious that none of these states will want to share their territory.{0}The second option is the creation of national autonomies. Yes, in some countries they have already been implemented, but the Kurdish population is still systematically subjected to assimilation by the authorities. But even here the question arises - whose forces will implement and control the conditions of the future world?{0}At the moment, any outcomes can be expected...\r\nKurdistan must gain independence!\r\nThe principle of Kurdish national autonomy must prevail!\r\nlast conflict\r\nlast conflict\r\nlast two conflicts\r\nlast three conflicts\r\nThe results of the peace conference held in Switzerland, where three parties participated - the PRC, the USSR and the USA, were as follows:{0}{1}{0}{2}{0}{3}{0}{4}\r\nFour Kurdish regions - Turkish Kurdistan, Iraqi Kurdistan, Syrian Kurdistan and Iranian Kurdistan are united into a single state - the Republic of Kurdistan. A bicameral parliament, the People's Assembly, is being created, limited multiparty system is being introduced until 2000, until the situation stabilizes.

Thus, the Provisional Government of Kurdistan will be formed, consisting of leftist and democratic parties.\r\nAs a result of the multimillion-dollar protests in Turkey, the government of the <color=#2F4F4F>National Security Council</color> fell. In the elections that followed, <color=#8B0000>Workers' Party of Turkey</color> and <color=#006400>People's Republican Party</color> received an approximately equal number of votes, as a result of which they had to agree to an agreement and organize a coalition government, which was headed by the Social Democrat Bulent Ecevit.\r\nAccording to the agreement, the peacekeeping contingent of the USA and the USSR will be located in Turkey over the next two years.\r\nThree Kurdish regions - Iraqi Kurdistan, Syrian Kurdistan and Iranian Kurdistan are united into a single state - the Republic of Kurdistan.

Evren</color> stated that «the Greek government of the Republic of Cyprus is pursuing a systematic policy of oppressing the Turkish population and hatching plans for a military invasion of Northern Cyprus.» The leader of Turkey announced the start of a military operation to «liberate Cyprus», which supposedly always belonged to Turkey.{0}What can we do in this situation?\r\nSupport the invasion\r\nCondemn the invasion\r\nDo nothing\r\n\"The Turkish invasion of Cyprus is justified by numerous facts of violation of the rights of the Turkish population on the island, the intransigence of Western leaders on this issue provoked unnecessary bloodshed\", was the statement of the PRC leader regarding the recent Turkish invasion of Cyprus. {0}The world community mainly condemned invasion.\r\n\"The Turkish invasion of Cyprus is an unprecedented violation of international law and the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus, Turkey must immediately withdraw its troops from the island\", was the statement of the PRC leader regarding the recent Turkish invasion of Cyprus.{0}The world community, in general, condemned invasion.\r\nThe world community generally condemned the invasion.\r\nTurkish Cyprus\r\nUrge the US to accept Cyprus into NATO\r\nThe United States initiated an emergency vote in the NATO Council on the inclusion of the Republic of Cyprus in the organization (contrary to the charter, which prohibits the inclusion of countries with territorial conflicts). The Republic of Cyprus was unanimously accepted into the organization and the organization of arms supplies to the island has already begun.{0}Nevertheless, none of the NATO members is going to apply the fifth article of the charter and declare war on Turkey.\r\nThe United States refused to accept the Republic of Cyprus into NATO, citing the NATO Charter, according to which countries with territorial conflicts cannot join the organization.\r\nNegotiate with Britain to intervene\r\nЗдесь будет возможность помочь британским базам выбить турков (напомните сделать)\r\nрез 5\r\nTurkish invasion of Cyprus\r\nTurkey\r\nCyprus\r\nTurkey managed to completely occupy the entire island of Cyprus (with the exception of British bases).{0}All the Greek inhabitants of the island were evicted and deported to Greece, and a referendum was held on the island to become part of Turkey. {1}% of the inhabitants voted \"FOR\" joining Turkey.{0}The world community did not recognize such an occupation of Cyprus.\r\nThe Republic of Cyprus, thanks to the help of the allies, managed to dislodge Turkish troops from the island and liquidate the pro-Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The future of Cyprus depends entirely on subsequent negotiations.\r\nAfter several months of bloody battles, Turkey pulled back the troops, declaring \"the fulfillment of the objectives of the operation\", but it is clear that the Turkish military machine has run out of resources to continue such a long war.\r\nIran and Iraq, despite the dire consequences of the war, resumed clashes on the border.\r\nCyprus issue\r\nThe conflict between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots has been going on for over a decade. After the Turkish invasion in 1974, Cyprus was divided into two parts - the pro-Turkish Northern and the pro-Greek Republic of Cyprus. Complicating the whole situation are the presence of two British military bases - Akrotiri and Dhekelia.{0}With a strategically important position in the Mediterranean, Cyprus is certainly of interest.{0}China can put forward several options for solving the problem and mediate.{0}The first is the creation Cypriot Federation, which should involve the creation of two autonomies, a presidium with equal representation from both the Turkish and the Greek population (despite the preponderance of the latter).{0}The second option is to satisfy the irredentist sentiments of Greece and return Cyprus to its composition.{0} The third option is to satisfy Turkey's irredentist sentiments and return Cyprus to it.{0}The fourth option is to abolish Turkish Northern Cyprus and restore the situation to 1974.{0}However, Turkey and Greece may reject our mediation.\r\nWe must contribute to the creation of a federation of Greeks and Turks.\r\nCyprus must be Greek!\r\nCyprus must be Turkish!\r\nUnited Republic of Cyprus - the North must be abolished!\r\nPostpone negotiations.\r\nCyprus issue resolved! Our plan was approved in referendums in both parts of Cyprus.{0}Cyprus is now becoming a federation of two autonomies - Turkish and Greek. A presidium of 6 people is created (3 from the North, 3 from the South), who are re-elected every three years and annually replace the positions of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Linguistic and national equality is proclaimed in state institutions. British military bases are withdrawn from the island.\r\nCyprus issue resolved! According to our plan for resolving the situation, Cyprus was annexed to Greece as an autonomous region. The Turkish population is given the opportunity to either obtain Greek citizenship or receive funds to move to Turkey.{0}Not all countries approved of this turn of events, but the Turkish threat is now ruled out.\r\nCyprus issue resolved! According to our plan for resolving the situation, Cyprus was annexed to Turkey as an autonomous region. The Greek population is given the opportunity to either obtain Turkish citizenship or receive funds to move to Greece.{0}This alignment of events was not approved by all countries, however, the Greek threat and the oppression of the Turkish minority by the Greek majority are now excluded.\r\nCyprus issue resolved! Against the background of the decline of Turkish military power, Northern Cyprus was abolished and the entire territory was annexed to the Republic of Cyprus. The situation has returned to the situation before 1974, but the conflict may flare up again and with renewed vigor.\r\nWe will return to this issue another time.\r\nTurkey and Greece rejected our proposed plan for resolving the Cyprus issue and refused to negotiate.\r\nFederation of Cyprus\r\nGreek Cyprus\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nUSSR claims Turkish territory\r\nThe new Soviet leader, Grigory Romanov, who recently put forward the \"doctrine of counteracting world imperialism\", which the Western media called the \"Romanov Doctrine\" (similar to the \"Brezhnev Doctrine\"), announced claims to some Turkish lands.{0}\"We have already seen the aggressive intentions of Turkey towards neighboring countries, the Soviet Union cannot but worry about the security of the borders and straits, which are used by all the Black Sea powers\", was the statement of the Soviet leader.{0}The claims of the post-war years were again raised: on the territory of the former imperial lands - Kars, Artvin and Ardahan; as well as to the straits - Bosphorus and Dardanelles (together with nearby regions, including Istanbul).{0}Romanov also demanded the withdrawal of American troops from Turkey (Soviet troops must remain).{0}The world community has sharply criticized the \"aggressive and imperialist plans of the Soviet Union\" and is already preparing to adopt new sanctions against the USSR.\r\nStand up for Turkey ({0}: - 25.0, {2}: - 50.0)\r\nSupport the claims of the USSR\r\nThings happen...\r\nSatisfy the request of Syria, but obstruct the USSR ({0}: - 35.0, {2}: - 50.0)\r\nSatisfy the request of Syria and support the claims of the USSR ({0}: - 10.0)\r\nTogether with the United States to oppose the USSR.

However, the Soviet Union began its advance inland, and the troops that invaded from the territory of Bulgaria occupied the European part of the country, along with the straits. The American troops stationed there were instructed to retreat to Greek territory so as not to escalate an already dangerous stop.{0}The UN Security Council adopted a resolution condemning Soviet aggression, but no other action, except for the imposition of new sanctions on the Soviet Union, was not followed.{0}By order of Grigory Romanov, a red star was erected on the dome of Hagia Sophia.

Communism has triumphed.{0}\r\nGreat Turkey\r\nThe War for Ogaden\r\nAfter declaring independence, Somalia put forward a number of territorial claims to neighboring countries. The new government proclaimed the idea of «Great Somalia», which, as planned, was to include parts of the territories of Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, inhabited by a significant number of Somalis. In 1969, after the revolution, Mohamed Siad Barre came to power, proclaiming a course towards building socialism and intensifying foreign policy and economic contacts with the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. However, Barre did not give up territorial claims to his neighbors.{0}After the overthrow of the Ethiopian emperor, the pro-Soviet military, led by Mengistu, came to power in Ethiopia, and the country was heading into the abyss of anarchy and the widespread growth of separatism, especially in the north of the country in Eritrea. Somalia took advantage of the instability in Ethiopia, which began to support the Western Somali Liberation Front. From the mid-1970s, the Front waged an armed struggle for the separation of the Ogaden from Ethiopia and its annexation to Somalia.{0}Recently, the Somali army invaded the Ogaden, but contrary to Barre's expectations, the Soviet Union supported Ethiopia in the conflict, and socialist Somalia is increasingly gravitating towards cooperation with the United States, which has already promised to support him with weapons.{0}Perhaps we should support the Barre regime in order to stop the advance of Soviet influence in East Africa and get ourselves a true ally? Or, should we help Ethiopia and mark a thaw in our relations with the socialist camp?\r\nBreak off relations with Barre and help Ethiopia ({0}: - 3.0, {2}: - 5.0)\r\nLet's support Somalia in the struggle for the unity of the people ({0}: - 3.0, {2}: - 5.0)\r\nIgnore conflict\r\nWe, like most countries of the socialist camp, sent a contingent of our troops in support of Ethiopia against the aggression of Somalia. As a result, after long periods of retreat of the Ethiopian army, a full-scale offensive began against the invaders. Ethiopia and the Soviet Union are pleased with our actions, in contrast to the United States, which continues to send support to the Barre regime without success.\r\nIn a rapidly developing conflict, we supported the leader of Somalia, Barra, and sent weapons and equipment, for which he is very grateful to us. The first successes of the Somali army were consolidated by the successful capture of the city of Jijiga, and then Harer. However, upon the arrival of Soviet military assistance and volunteers, the war slowed down and began to have a clear positional character. Neither side has a decisive advantage. The USSR and Ethiopia condemned aid to Somalia, while relations with the US improved.\r\nBarre's first successful victories turned into a complete failure after the arrival of Soviet specialists and various volunteer groups. The war is increasingly drawn into position, and the victory of Ethiopia is a matter of a few weeks. \r\nEthiopian-Somali conflict\r\nSomalia\r\nEthiopia\r\nBarre's dream came true! The leader of Somalia managed to return Ogaden to his native harbor and strengthen his regime.\r\nThe Ethiopian government succeeded in driving Somali troops out of Ogaden territory and forcing Somalia to sign peace.\r\nChairman! We received news of the end of the war.\r\nZimbabwe\r\nBurkina Faso\r\nThe USSR pacifies its satellites\r\nChairman! The incredible happened! Soviet leader Grigory Romanov made an appeal stating that \"counter-revolution has again matured in the fraternal socialist countries\", which \"is preparing an anti-communist and anti-Soviet coup in a number of countries of the Warsaw Commonwealth\". In this regard, G. Romanov announced the introduction of Soviet troops to \"protect socialism from imperialism\" in the following socialist countries: {1}.{0}The USSR had sent troops to the countries of the Eastern Bloc before, but not in half of them immediately! In the current situation, we must apply something, but what can we do if Europe is so far from China?\r\nPoland, Romania, Hungary and Mongolia\r\nPoland, Romania and Hungary\r\nWe'll have to deal with this...\r\nCondemn Soviet policy!\r\nBreak off relations and arrange for the Soviet Union \"New Damansky\"!

({2}: - 75.0)\r\nThe Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with the PRC. \r\nThe Soviet Union from the territories of the GDR, Czechoslovakia sent troops into \"disloyal socialist countries\". Despite the attempts of local leaders to mobilize forces in defense of their own regimes, they failed to do this due to the low support of citizens, who, although they met the Soviet invasion ambiguously (associations from 1956 and 1968), understood that the current regimes were even worse and more authoritarian.{0}After the overthrow of the governments, the local communist and socialist parties were disbanded and transformed into new ones, however, the former members were not included automatically, as they had to rejoin. party, thus violating the established tradition of leading either the parliament or the government besides the party.{0}However, as conceived by the Soviet leaders, this should return the countries to \"collective leadership\"{0}The Communist Party of Romania was headed by Ilie Verdets, the Communist Party Hungary - Gyula Türmer (former ambassador to the USSR), and the Communist Party of Poland - Kazimierz Bartsikovsky.{0}The new governments began to pursue a policy in line with Soviet socialism.{0}{1}\r\n\"The Soviet Union is pursuing a social-imperialist policy and, thereby, threatening the world with the escalation of the Cold War. It is unacceptable to resolve political issues by force and invade sovereign states every time there is a change of government\", such a rather harsh statement was made by the Chinese Foreign Minister. {0}The response of the Soviet Foreign Ministry was China's accusations of revisionism and aggressive policy in the East.{0}The Soviet Union sent troops from the territories of the GDR, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia into \"disloyal socialist countries\".

The Soviet Army is preparing to land on the island.{0}The leader of the USSR, Grigory Romanov, threatened China with \"the most decisive retaliatory actions if Chinese troops do not immediately stop crossing the Ussuri,\" and also stated that \"at one time Russia claimed a number of Chinese territories, the Ili Region, Yellow Russia, maybe it's time for us to recall these unrealized projects?\".{0}{1}\r\nSoviet troops of the Trans-Baikal Military District entered Ulaanbaatar, where, under pressure from Soviet representatives, Yumzhagiin Tsedenbal agreed to intensify repressions against pro-Chinese politicians gaining influence. After that, the leader of Mongolia resigned \"for health reasons\", and the post of head of the party and the presidium of the parliament was given to the former chairman of the government, Jambyn Batmunkh. \r\nJapanese empire\r\nRed Japan\r\nBrothers in mind\r\nIn the 70s, the Juche ideology was just beginning to develop and was called \"Kimirsenism\". Korean ideologists presented Kimirsenism as a creative application of the Stalinist version of Marxism-Leninism in the Korean context, and Stalinist Marxism itself as the only correct version of Marxism-Leninism, and Kim Il Sung himself was proclaimed \"the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.\" But in the 1980s, everything changed: the Juche ideology completely acquired precise formulations and finally separated into an independent idea. {0}During these years, Kim Il Sung published a number of articles on the Juche idea, which finally formed it as a philosophical system. And his son and heir Kim Jong Il, in turn, completed his father's work and in his writings, in particular in the work \"On the Juche Idea\" of 1982, he deduced the main postulates of the Juche ideology.{0}However, not everyone accepts such changes unambiguously : Some party members claim that Juche is nothing more than a Korean version of Marxism-Leninism with national characteristics, others claim that Juche has become a revisionist theory and is moving away from the Marxist principles of people's government of the state and the fight against traditionalism and bureaucracy, while the most radical Marxist philosophers openly declare Juche is nothing more than a left-wing synthesis of Confucianism and the traditional Korean religion of Cheondogyo.{0}And how will we react as a neighbor of the DPRK and its longtime partner?\r\nLet's congratulate the North Korean comrades on the development of Marxist ideas.\r\nWe will significantly reduce relations with the DPRK and declare Juche a revision.\r\nForcefully remove the tyrannical dictatorship in North Korea ({2}: - 25.0)\r\nNorth Korea is no longer a friend, we will increase relations with South Korea, it is financially more profitable.\r\nThese are their internal affairs. We don't react.\r\nThe state system must be more radical than social democracy...\r\nThe military alliance has not been created...\r\nNo modifier \"Stronghold of Maoism\"...\r\nThe radical left is not leading...\r\nToo soft military doctrine...\r\nThe state system is not liberalism...\r\nWe have already established trade with South Korea...\r\nThe economy should be more liberal than the \"Birdcage\"...\r\nThe state system should be more liberal than dengism...\r\nAs the great leader Comrade Lenin said: \"Many paths lead to socialism\". And the North Korean path - Juche - is just one of the many national variants of the paths of socialism in accordance with their culture, history and geographical location. So why should we blame them? We have traveled the same path and are happy to welcome the self-determination of our North Korean comrades.\r\n\"Juche is not the Marxism-Leninism of the Stalinist theory, but is a bureaucratic revision aimed at suppressing the broad masses. Postulating the unsurpassed role of the Leader, Juche discards the role of the party, denies the leading role of the proletariat, replaces the proletarian governing bodies and the proletarian dictatorship with the dictatorship of the bureaucracy. Juche is no more than a bureaucratic counter-revolution, the last step before the complete restoration of capitalism. To protect the world socialist movement, we must contain the North Korean revision at all costs - diplomatically, economically, by the fleet. There is nothing left for us but to isolate this infection\", - such was the official statement of the political leadership of China People's Republic.\r\n\"Juche is not the Marxism-Leninism of the Stalinist theory, but is a bureaucratic revision aimed at suppressing the broad masses.

Juche is no more than the bureaucratic counter-revolution, which is the restoration of capitalism.Juche is only a form of state capitalism, referring to Korean traditions and backward feudal-capitalist foundations for the sole purpose of suppressing the proletariat and its further exploitation in favor of the new bourgeois elite of the DPRK. the capitalist North Korean junta will not pass - we are ready to protect our Korean brothers at any cost!\", - such was the final decision made at a closed meeting of the political leadership of the People's Republic of China before organizing an armed intervention in the territory of North Korea.\r\nAfter the deformed Stalinist regime of North Korea finally fell, it turned into a totalitarian cannibalistic junta. The ruling leadership of China made a wise decision to break off relations with this dead dog Kim Il Sung and finally move from the policy of the primacy of ideology to the policy of the primacy of economics in foreign policy relations. Openly blaming the North Korean regime, the Chinese authorities began to establish direct and successful contacts with the South Korean authorities, in particular, by opening trade routes for South Korean electronics to China, opening up advanced foreign electronic technologies to their population and industry. This mutually beneficial agreement has undoubtedly benefited both China and South Korea, pleasing \"Uncle Sam\", and the only dissatisfied were the North Korean dictators.\r\nWhat is happening in North Korea has not been commented on in any way by the Chinese government agencies and print media, despite the ongoing debate among European philosophers. But China is not Europe, but North Korea is a longtime partner of China, so why interfere in the affairs of a sovereign state?\r\nSino-North Korean War\r\nNorth Korea\r\nChina\r\nState of Korea\r\nSRK\r\nPRK\r\nKorean Union\r\nThe People's Liberation Army of China entered Pyongyang and overthrew the government of Kim Il Sung, arresting key figures of the previous regime.{0}The Chinese leadership formed a puppet government headed by {2}.

According to our secret services, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Yuri Andropov, at the last meeting of the Politburo announced the need for the Soviet Union to join the North Atlantic Alliance, arguing this with the increased influence of China and the fact that we are sending weapons to the Afghan opposition.{0}And, it would seem, this should have ended in failure, because the entire alliance is built on the principles of Western democracy, but the US President, Jimmy Carter, has already announced that \"major changes will happen soon in NATO\".{0}With influence in Eastern Europe, we could do something to prevent the creation of this \"anti-Chinese alliance\".\r\nNothing to do...\r\nCondemn the Andropov-Carter Pact!\r\nWe are mobilizing all resources for an uprising in Eastern Europe!

Juche is nothing more than the last step before the complete restoration of capitalism, carried out in the form of the privatization of the people's dictatorship by a cabal of several military clans and appealing to the reactionary remnants of Korean traditionalism in order to deceive the people by distracting them from the ongoing changes.To protect the world socialist movement, we must restrain the revision at any cost - diplomatically, economically, by the fleet.In this regard, the Chinese and Soviet representatives, together with representatives of other CMEA countries, held a special conference and, thanks to well-coordinated work Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and international organizations, the North Korean leadership carried out a struggle against counter-revolutionary elements,\" the official representative of the PRC said at the regular session of the CMEA.{0}Earlier, Kim Il Sung pleaded guilty to the ideological mistakes made by a member of the Presidium of the Politburo of the WPK, General Oh Jin Woo, and personally expelled him from the party, the political distortions of the 1980s were abolished, and Kim Jong Il, having come out with self-criticism because of their support, left the Central Military Commission, remaining in the ranks of the Politburo, the Presidium and the Secretariat.{0}In general, the world Analysts view such an event as a refusal by the North Korean authorities to toughen and militarize governance and as a return to the old Stalinist guidelines, and the reason is \"joint Sino-Soviet pressure and threats\".\r\nJapan\r\nThe Polish leadership declared its adherence to the Warsaw Pact and refused to leave it. \r\nThe Hungarian leadership declared its adherence to the Warsaw Pact and refused to leave it. \r\nThe Romanian leadership declared its commitment to the Warsaw Pact and refused to leave it. \r\nThe leadership of the Communist Party of Slovakia declared its adherence to the Warsaw Pact, but since the congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia approved entry into NATO, the Slovaks declared their independence from Czechoslovakia.

This letter (as well as the answer to it) was replicated in many Soviet, American and European media.{0}However, a new treaty was signed with the Warsaw Pact countries.{0}A temporary option was adopted, where the Warsaw Pact in its current state continues to exist until 1985, that is, until the year when it was originally supposed to be renegotiated.{0}It can be assumed that this is only a temporary calm before a new storm, and the \"battle for the Soviet legacy\" will still make itself felt. \r\nAfter rather long and bloody battles between the remnants of the Warsaw Pact and NATO, the threat of nuclear war seemed quite real for the Soviet and American sides.

Constantly \"burying\" and \"digging up\" the corpse of a man who died 30 years ago, you will not achieve anything significant,\" was the comment of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the new round of \"re-Stalinization\" in the Soviet Union.{0}{1}{0}{2}.\r\nLet's wait for new details!{0}{1}{0}{2}\r\nThe Albanian leadership congratulated the Soviet Union on the victory over the social-imperialist and Khrushchevite factions, and also applied for a return to the CMEA and the Warsaw Pact.\r\nAgainst this background, the Yugoslav military leadership congratulated the Soviet leadership on entering the \"new era\", and also applied for entry into the CMEA and the Warsaw Pact.\r\nFrom Lisbon to Vladivostok\r\nFrom Bonn to Vladivostok\r\nAlexander Yakovlev, the leader of the USSR, in his speech in Brussels announced that the Soviet Union and the socialist countries had adopted a \"five-year economic integration plan\", according to which by 1990 the Soviet bloc should be fully integrated into the European Economic Community, and the CMEA should be completely dissolved.{0}Here is a short summary of Mr. Yakovlev's speech, where he announced the beginning of reforms:{0}\"The Soviet Union and our working class did not go through all the hardships and thorns of capitalism, therefore, in order to modernize socialism and build a communist society, it is vitally necessary to \"reforge Lenin's swords on Plekhanov's plowshares\" to defend our revolution. Russia's unpreparedness led us to degenerate, slow down the revolution, and instead of genuine socialism, we got state capitalism! Now we should abandon this deformed form of capitalism in favor of a natural formational approach in order to save the future of communism!{0}We must stand firmly on three principles: revolutionary defencism - we will defend our revolution from the encroachments of the reactionaries from the East, who are wielding the despotic Asian method of production; democracy - since socialism cannot live without democracy, just as a fish cannot live without water; the socialist market is the third way, which will recreate in itself the advantages of all systems and will allow us to modernize the country and prepare it for a natural transition to communism.\"{0}What will happen next with the Soviet Union is still difficult to predict...\r\nWe can only wonder...\r\nUnited Germany\r\nAnother noteworthy event - after a speech in Brussels, Yakovlev visited East Berlin, where a triumphant event took place - the leaders of the USSR and the USA declared that \"The Cold War is over once and for all\", and therefore its main symbol is the wall separating the two Berlins - \"must be destroyed, and the German people become united again\".{0}A project was proposed to unite Germany into a confederation with a single army, freedom of movement, but different currencies, economic systems and governments (although a collegiate presidium is provided for discussing all-German issues). {0}The document \"On the unification of Germany\" was signed by two leaders of Germany - Chairman of the State Council of the GDR Erich Honecker and Federal Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl, as well as the leaders of the USA and the USSR as victorious members of the anti-Hitler coalition.\r\nThe PRC leadership decided to provide the maximum possible assistance to the Albanian separatists. Thanks to the connections of the Ministry of State Security in the Balkans, established during the years of the Chinese-Albanian alliance, a large amount of weapons, equipment and money was quickly delivered to Kosovo, which made it possible to organize armed resistance to the units of the JNA and the People's Militia introduced into the region. {0}At the moment, there are street battles in Pristina (in which the Yugoslav units actively use tanks and artillery), and in Prizren and Pech, the JNA controls only the administrative quarters. We also receive information that the Albanian leadership is seriously considering the issue of bringing its troops into Kosovo and is probing the possible reaction of the USSR and the USA to this step.\r\nGuarantee Albania its assistance in the operation. ({0}: - 20.0, {1}: - 20.0)\r\nDissuade the Albanian leadership from this adventure.({0}: - 3.0, {1}: - 3.0)\r\nIt seems that our Balkan partners need to be \"friends\". Forced. ({0}: - 15.0, {1}: - 30.0)\r\nLet them decide what to do.\r\nAlbanians won't listen to us...\r\nWe don't have an economic union...\r\nWe need restored relations with the USSR OR a Treaty of Friendship with the USA...\r\nOperation Breakout\r\nBack in November 1977, Albanian Interior Minister Kadri Hazbiu sent a report to the country's leadership analyzing a possible solution to territorial conflicts with Yugoslavia, in which he proposed to wait for the death of Yugoslav President Tito and prepare a plan for a military attack on the SFRY. In January-March 1979, large-scale exercises \"Biza\" and \"Citadel\" were held, which showed the complete unpreparedness of the Albanian People's Army for a clash with the JNA.{0}However, now that Tito is no more, and fighting continues between government forces and formations in Kosovo separatists, the leadership of Albania assesses the likelihood of a successful armed intervention as quite high. We don't know exactly what NATO's position is, but the Internal Affairs Department reported through unofficial channels that it did not intend to intervene provided the military operation was limited.{0}The \"Breakthrough\" operation plan provides for the deployment of 220,000 ANA troops to Yugoslavia, of which 65% are in Kosovo and 35% to Albanian-speaking communities in Macedonia and Montenegro. In fact, it was supposed to use all available forces and means, including reserves. This turned the operation into a full-scale war in which Albania should not have lost under any circumstances, since such an outcome could lead not only to the collapse of the regime, but also to the loss of statehood. \r\nWe promised to help our Albanian comrades in full in the conflict with Yugoslavia—that useless atavism of the Versailles Peace, which has long since outlived its usefulness. On June 26, ANA units crossed the border and launched an offensive against Pristina (where fighting is still ongoing), Skopje and Titograd. The territorial defense of Kosovo was disarmed by the Yugoslav troops at the beginning of the year for unreliability, but the very first clashes between the Albanian units and the much better prepared and armed JNA led to the fact that the offensive stalled and the Albanian troops were unable to take a single city.{0}The United States demanded that Albania \"immediately and unconditionally\" withdraw its troops and sharply increased the volume of military assistance to the SFRY, but the USSR limited itself to condemning the aggression and called on the parties to a peaceful dialogue.\r\nYugoslav–Albanian War\r\nAlbania\r\nYugoslavia\r\nThe Albanian leadership agreed with our arguments that Operation Breakthrough was a dangerous gamble that could lead to unpredictable consequences. All documents on it were ordered to be destroyed, and in the newspaper «Zёri i popullit» an editorial was published under the heading «Bulgarian blackmail and threats will not pass in the Balkans», in which Bulgaria (and indirectly the USSR) is accused of «intimidating the peoples of Yugoslavia».{0}The Yugoslav leadership positively assessed this publication, as well as the Albanian side's characterization of Bulgaria as «a weapon in the service of an aggressive policy against the peoples of Albania, Yugoslavia and Greece». Relations between old adversaries have even improved slightly, which has resulted in several joint infrastructure projects.\r\nThe Albanian leadership ignored our arguments, believing that «the Chinese comrades are unnecessarily reinsuring themselves and Yugoslavia, after the death of the revisionist Tito, is already in the grave with one foot», sanctioning the operation «Breakthrough» contrary to our warnings. On June 26, ANA units crossed the border and launched an offensive against Pristina (where fighting is still ongoing), Skopje and Titograd. The territorial defense of Kosovo was disarmed by the Yugoslav troops at the beginning of the year for unreliability, but the very first clashes between the Albanian units and the much better prepared and armed JNA led to the fact that the offensive stalled and the Albanian troops failed to take a single city.{0}Having learned about our position, the USSR and the USA jointly condemned the Albanian aggression and expanded their military assistance to the SFRY.\r\nWhen we learned about the Albanian plans, we remembered Mao and Enlai's long-standing idea of a Tirana-Belgrade-Bucharest axis that would check Soviet and American aspirations in the Balkans and allow China to intervene in the European theater of the Cold War. Yugoslavia's vague position, Albania's aggressive isolationism, and Romania's growing claims to independence from the USSR bored us and even the superpowers, so we took the situation into our own hands. Under threats and political and economic pressure, Albania, Yugoslavia and Romania were forced to hold joint talks in Vientiane [approx. - the capital of Laos] and agree to the creation of the «Balkan Commonwealth» - a regional organization with «soft» terms of membership, the purpose of which is the settlement of disputes, economic and cultural cooperation, as well as collective security. The Romanian leadership announced its withdrawal from the military structures of the Department of Internal Affairs (while formally remaining in the bloc), which irritated the USSR.{0}It is unlikely that this association will be sustainable... although who knows...\r\nThe crisis in the SFRY, turning into a full-scale internal political conflict with the participation of external forces after the death of Josip Broz Tito (as Enver Hoxha predicted in early 1980), did not come. After the Shebeniku-81 exercises, which showed the impossibility of quickly completing the tasks of Operation Breakthrough, the Albanian leadership ordered to stop its development and destroy the available materials. A new war in the Balkans did not happen this time.\r\nAfter heavy fighting on the Kosovo-Metochian Plain and in Macedonia, the leadership of Yugoslavia, under pressure from the Warsaw Pact and NATO (fearing the expansion of the conflict and drawing superpowers into it), was forced to admit defeat and agree with Albanian claims to Kosovo, the Presovo Valley, the western communities of Macedonia and the southern communities Montenegro. The news of this led to thousands of demonstrations in Belgrade demanding «not to give up Kosovo», which were quickly joined by soldiers of the territorial defense and volunteer detachments returning from the front. Taking advantage of the situation, a group of high-ranking officials led by Hamdia Pozderats and Fikret Abdich, with the support of the JNA generals, carried out a coup d'état. A state of emergency was introduced, the entire old leadership of Yugoslavia was arrested, the country announced a break in the agreement with the CMEA, a rejection of the policy of non-alignment and applied to join the EEC, agreeing to a plan for large-scale market reforms. And the Albanian nationalists are celebrating the victory and looking at the Greek Northern Epirus...\r\nAs expected, the JNA pushed the weak Albanian army back across the border without much difficulty. However, this time in Belgrade it was decided to finally «close the issue» and, after the transfer of additional forces to Kosovo and the defeat of the remaining separatist bands, the Yugoslav troops launched an offensive deep into Albanian territory. The vaunted network of bunkers proved useless against modern Soviet and American-made weapons, and the demoralized Albanian units surrendered en masse. The entire territory of Albania was occupied by Yugoslavia, which established a government in Tirana from the dissidents of the Albanian Party of Labor, headed by Liri Belishova. The remnants of the ANA retreated into the highlands, where guerrilla warfare continues sluggishly, while the rest of the country began the persecution of the Hoxaists and the introduction of «socialist self-government». The victory in the war caused an increase in patriotic sentiments in the SFRY and noticeably smoothed out separatist tendencies in the Western republics.\r\nNew Chameria\r\nThe victory in the war with Yugoslavia led the Albanian leadership to the idea that the creation of a Greater Albania was an achievable task. For this, it remains only to annex the northern part of Epirus, called Chameria by the Albanians and now belonging to Greece. During the Second World War, the local population actively supported the Italian and German invaders, for which, after 1945, many Albanians and Muslim Greeks were expelled to Albania. The Hoxhaist leadership for the time being tried not to raise this topic, but the withdrawal of Greece from NATO and the withdrawal of the US Sixth Fleet from its bases untied his hands. According to our information, Sigurimi is preparing an «uprising» of a small group of 40-50 people called the «Army for the Liberation of Chameria», which is supposed to capture the coastal town of Igoumenitsa and call on the Albanian army to enter Chameria \"to protect against the Greek monarcho-fascists.\"{0} The fact that there has been no monarchy in Greece for a long time and now a left-wing coalition government with the participation of the Communists is in power is not of particular interest to Albanian revanchists.\r\nThis is not our business\r\nEliminate these clowns and threaten Albania with sanctions\r\nThere is a wrong left in Greece. Therefore, we are in ({0}: - 15.0, {1}: - 35.0)\r\nNeed a modifier \"Stronghold of Maoism\" OR Left-wing radicals are in the lead...\r\nGreco-Albanian War\r\nAlbania\r\nGreece\r\nThe operation of the Albanian special services did not go exactly according to plan - the boats with the landing force were discovered by the Greek border guards and fired upon, as a result of which the element of surprise was lost. However, the «Army for the Liberation of Chameria» managed to break into the city and capture the radio tower, giving the signal to attack. The Albanian People's Army has crossed the border and is already advancing without much resistance. Although the Warsaw Pact and NATO do not intend to intervene in another conflict, Soviet and American ships blockaded Albania from the sea and prevent trade with it.\r\nEarly in the morning of May 16, a cruise missile launched and unnoticed by the Albanian missile defense system flew into the camp of the \"Army for the Liberation of Chameria\" from the Mediterranean Sea. All saboteurs died on the spot. China threatened the PSRA with large-scale economic sanctions if it did not stop provoking another war in the Balkans, to which the Albanian leadership (whose plans were published by us and caused a sharp reaction from the USSR and the USA) was forced to agree. Greece severed diplomatic relations with Albania and accused it of “social imperialism”, and we are receiving information about purges in the military-political elite of the PSRA - this is how, according to unverified reports, the Minister of National Defense Prokop Murra and director Sigurimi Zyulyuftar Ramizi were shot. Also, the Albanian authorities unofficially \"advise\" their organizations to reduce trade contacts with us, and anti-Chinese excerpts from the works of Enver Hoxha began to appear more and more often in the press.\r\nChina expressed interest in resolving the territorial issue with Greece, which was accepted with gratitude by the Albanian leadership. Under the guidance of our instructors, the operation has been redesigned and better thought out. As a result, the «Army for the Liberation of Chameria» was able to cross the border unnoticed and easily capture Igoumenitsa, giving the signal to advance. The Albanian People's Army is advancing successfully without meeting resistance, but our intervention has been discovered by the USSR and the USA. No matter how reluctant they are to help the Greek government, which criticizes both superpowers, the fear of China's rise is stronger. The Sixth Fleet blockaded the coast of Albania, preventing trade with it, and Soviet weapons flow like a river through the Straits into Greek harbors.\r\nTaking into account the experience of the war with Yugoslavia, the Albanian army acted more competently, and the Greek troops were much weaker than the JNA. Having suffered a number of defeats, the Greek government was forced to sue for peace and agree to the Albanian demands. A mass rally was held on Skanderbeg Square in Tirana, at which Adil Charchani, to the roar of the crowd, announced «the great revival of the Albanian nation, which broke the fetters of the Titoist and monarcho-fascist enslavers, reunited into a single whole and proved its right to leadership in the Balkans», after which he read a declaration to break all «unequal oppressive agreements», including with China. The USSR and the USA agreed that they would impose economic sanctions against Albania and any country that recognizes its new borders, as a result of which those willing to cooperate with the PSRA have sharply decreased.{0}However, in the wake of the patriotic upsurge in the PSRA, reforms began in the spirit, and Enver Hoxha was posthumously proclaimed «Eternal President of Albania and Leader of the Nation». In Greece, the news of the defeat sparked a radical rise in radical sentiment, resulting in the formation of the Coalition of the Radical and Ecological Left, led by the legendary hero of the Resistance, Manolis Glezos. In the early elections, she defeated the PASOK-GCP bloc and proclaimed «the fight against the Great Albanian chauvinists until the complete reunification of the Motherland», establishing contacts with both the Warsaw Pact and NATO for a large-scale military reform, for which she introduced an austerity regime.\r\nThis time, Albania did not succeed - the Greek army was able to push back its opponents and, under the threat of a continuation of the offensive, Albania asked for peace. However, the Greek leadership refused to negotiate and only after the fall of Vlora agreed to consider peace proposals. The PSRA had to agree to pay a huge indemnity and withdraw its territorial claims against Greece. To comply with the obligations assumed by the Albanian side, a limited contingent of Greek troops in the amount of 7.5 thousand people remains in the south of the country.{0}The defeat led to an aggravation of the internal party struggle in the Albanian elite, in which the technocratic wing, led by Fatos Nano, took over, concentrating efforts on economic reforms and normalization of relations with neighbors.{0}In turn, in Greece, the PASOK-GCP coalition was accused of the fact that it was its withdrawal from NATO that made the Albanian aggression possible. The PASOK right wing agreed with these accusations and formed a coalition with «New Democracy», forcing the government, which had lost its parliamentary majority, to resign. The new Greek authorities have already notified NATO of their agreement to return to the alliance.\r\nThis time, Albania did not succeed - the Greek army was able to push back its opponents and, under the threat of a continuation of the offensive, Albania asked for peace. The Greek leadership demanded only to compensate for the damage from the hostilities and to extradite the militants of the «Chameria Liberation Army» (* recognized as a terrorist organization in Greece) for trial. The parties somehow agreed that Greece would not insist on the payment of reparations and would limit itself to accepting an official apology, while Albania itself would condemn the perpetrators (however, most of them got off with short prison terms). The long-awaited peace has come.\r\nGreat Albania\r\nElections in France\r\nSince the last presidential election, the political situation in France has seriously changed.{0}General Program of the Left, created in 1972 by the <color=#006400>Socialists</color> led by <color=#006400>François Mitterrand</color> and the <color=#8B0000>French Communist Party</color> led by <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchais</color>, still continues to exist, but the coalition itself is actually broken and the left has no single candidate for elections.

Lunch in Daejeon, dinner in Busan\".\r\nAt the head of the new North Korea were placed the remnants of the Yan'an faction, the Korean communists, who, before the surrender of Japan, were trained and stationed on Chinese territory. The country itself was headed by Lieutenant General Kim Ung, who was repressed in 1958, rehabilitated in 1970, and again repressed in 1978, who began the gradual integration of North Korea into the Chinese sphere of influence. The revamped WPK promised to \"right right all the wrong done during the reign of the Kims\".\r\nAfter our victory, the Workers' Party of Korea was purged of the revisionists. She formed a coalition government with the Korean Social Democratic Party and implemented top-priority reforms \"to correct the dictatorship of the proletariat\": increasing social assistance for pensioners and the disabled, increasing the power of local councils, allowing more than one candidate for parliamentary elections, and admitting non-partisan candidates for parliamentary elections. However, the new government officially announced that it would continue to adhere to the line of supporting the dictatorship of the proletariat and Marxism-Leninism.\r\nDemocratic socialism - The famous female revolutionary Pak Chong-ae, who fell under repression in 1966, was placed at the head of the new North Korea. Having come to power, she took up the democratization of the regime on a \"mass\" basis: the power of the WPK was significantly reduced, and women's, youth, trade union and other organizations became independent on the basis of the principle of self-government. All censorship was abolished and the personality cult of Kim Il Sung was debunked by analogy with the Khrushchev project, and Kim Il Sung himself was accused of building a \"totalitarian patriarchal society.\r\nSocial Democracy - Unexpectedly for everyone, the remnants of the Democratic Independent Party (Democratic Independent Party) - a moderate party supporting the unification of the two Koreas, which operated in North Korea until 1962 and South Korea until 1950, were invited to lead the new North Korea.

The purged Chondoist Chongu Party was put in charge and declared \"Chondogyo, Spiritual Traditional and Neo-Confucianism\" as its official ideology, thereby correcting North Korea's official general line with Chinese ideology.\r\nAfter the victory in North Korea, communism and communist movements were banned, and the leaders of the Workers' Party of Korea were hanged. The purged Chondoist Chongu Party was put in charge and declared \"Chondogyo, Spiritual Traditional and Neo-Confucianism\" as its official ideology, thereby correcting North Korea's official general line with Chinese ideology.\r\nUnexpectedly for everyone, General Oh Jin Woo, the \"martyr of the revolution\" and the third influential person in the DPRK under Kim Il Sung, was placed at the head of North Korea. Oh Jin Woo, after long conversations personally with the President of the PRC, renounced relations with the Kim family, called them traitors to the revolution and, having received the rank of marshal, established an even more cruel and authoritarian regime in the country. L Jin Woo ended his speech on the importance of uniting the North Korean people through the coming hardships for the benefit of the world revolution with the words: \"I will wipe Busan off the face of the earth in a week if the revolution requires it. Lunch in Daejeon, dinner in Busan.\"\r\nThe famous female revolutionary Pak Chong-ae, who fell under repression in 1966, was put at the head of the new North Korea. Having come to power, she took up the democratization of the regime on a \"mass\" basis: the power of the WPK was significantly reduced, and women's, youth, trade union and other organizations became independent on the basis of the principle of self-government. All censorship was abolished and the personality cult of Kim Il Sung was debunked by analogy with the Khrushchev project, and Kim Il Sung himself was accused of building a \"totalitarian patriarchal society.\r\nDespite the expected change of power, the son of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, was appointed the new ruler, who continued to rule the country after his father signed a surrender, according to which the Kim dynasty remains in power, but North Korea becomes a virtual puppet of China. Having come to power in order to save the country from post-war problems, Kim Jong Il allowed small businesses, expanded trade cooperation and announced the transition of small and medium-sized state enterprises to self-support and self-government.\r\nThe new North Korea was headed by the resignations of the Yan'an faction, Korean communists who had been trained and stationed on Chinese territory before the surrender of Japan. The country itself was headed by Lieutenant General Kim Ung, who was repressed in 1958, rehabilitated in 1970 and repressed again in 1978, who began the gradual integration of North Korea into the Chinese sphere of influence. The updated TPK promised to \"straighten out all the wrong things done during the reign of the Kims.\"\r\nAt the head of the new North Korea was put the purged \"Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way\" (Chondoist Chongu Party), which declared its official ideology \"Chondoge, spiritual traditional socialism, anti-urbanism and anti-industrialism\", thereby correcting the official general line of North Korea with Chinese ideology. The Workers' Party of Korea was officially banned and repressed as bourgeois and anti-people.\r\nIn 1973, Libya, taking advantage of the civil war in a neighboring state, occupied the Auzu strip, a narrow strip on the border of Libya and Chad, rich in uranium deposits, and in 1976 annexed it.{0}In Chad itself, there is a conflict between various political forces, during which Paris and Tripoli support the opposing sides. But all this fades against the background of Gaddafi's ambitions to expand Libya's influence in Africa. Despite a number of failed projects to unite Arab countries, the leader of the Libyan revolution still dreams of ousting French influence from the continent, while President Valery Giscard d'Estaing seeks to retain at least some influence in the former French colonies.\r\nWho's who?\r\nLibya\r\nChad\r\nLibya continues to expand arms supplies to pro-Libyan forces in Chad. However, it is not yet clear how long this conflict will last...\r\nLibya managed to defeat the troops of the pro-French government of Chad and take N'Djamena, the country's capital. For the first time, Gadaffi managed to expand his zone of influence and establish a pro-Libyan puppet regime of the left-nationalist National Liberation Front of Chad, led by Goukouni Oueddei, who recognized the Libyan occupation of Aouzou.{0}Against the backdrop of military and diplomatic successes, the nationalist frenzy in the Libyan media and ideology is only growing...\r\nThe anti-Libyan forces managed to combine their efforts and dislodge Gadaffi's troops from the territory of Chad and the Aouzu strip. The pro-Western anti-communist regime of Hissein Habré was established in Chad. Gadaffi again suffered a diplomatic defeat, it seems that he still needs to grow to dominance in the region...\r\nA war between two Yemens?\r\nIn 1972, there was another short-term conflict between North Yemen and South Yemen, which resulted in the Cairo Agreements, which consolidated the desire of the two countries to unite. Nevertheless, no fundamental steps have been taken in this direction over the years.{0}The Government of Northern Yemen is now accusing its southern neighbor of sponsoring and supporting a revolutionary organization, the National Democratic Front. Shots can be heard from both sides on the border of the two states.{0}It is unlikely that this conflict will be able to develop into a full-fledged war, but we can \"help\" in fomenting it, because Yemen is a strategic place for both the USSR and the United States. Since the late 1960s, the Soviet Union has been building up a contingent of troops in the country and developing a naval base, so we can try to knock its positions out of the region.\r\nFomenting conflict in favor of North Yemen ({1}: - 5.0, {2}: - 10.0)\r\nFomenting conflict in favor of South Yemen ({1}: - 5.0, {2}: - 10.0)\r\nIgnore\r\nAfter the relatively rapid advance of the forces of South Yemen and the capture of several border points, the troops of North Yemen managed to repel enemy air attacks and launch a counteroffensive, but already on the territory of South Yemen. {0}It looks like the escalation of the conflict has reached its highest stage. \r\nAfter the relatively rapid advance of the forces of South Yemen and the capture of several border points, leftist rebels sponsored by the South have raised a number of uprisings against the government of North Yemen. Within 3 days of the invasion, the numerically smaller forces of South Yemen established complete air superiority over the theater of operations, thereby forcing the Land Forces of North Yemen to lag behind until the end of the war.{0}It seems that the escalation of the conflict has reached its highest stage. \r\nAfter the relatively rapid advance of the forces of South Yemen and the capture of several border points, the war ended with the signing of an agreement in Kuwait mediated by the League of Arab States, which again fixed the position on the desire to unite the two countries.{0}The war also revealed the chronic technical and military lag of the North from the South, as the South managed to establish unconditional superiority in the air.\r\nYemen War\r\nNorth Yemen\r\nSouth Yemen\r\nUnited Yemen\r\nThe troops of North Yemen, supported by the United States and its allies, managed to take the capital of South Yemen - Aden. The army of the South collapsed and stopped resisting. South Yemen was annexed to the North, and the Yemeni Socialist Party was banned. \r\nThe troops of South Yemen, which support the USSR, the socialist camp countries, Syria and Libya, managed to take the capital of North Yemen - Sanaa. The Army of the North collapsed and stopped resisting. North Yemen was annexed to the South.\r\nThe Yemeni conflict has ended the status quo. Agreements were signed in Kuwait with the mediation of the League of Arab States, which again fixed the provision on the desire to unite the two countries.\r\nThe Libyan-Chadian conflict\r\nNeo-Romanov Empire\r\nQuite unexpectedly, Soviet leader Grigory Romanov said that \"some countries of the socialist commonwealth have expressed a desire to join the Soviet Union, respecting their right to self-determination, we cannot deny them this, but it is necessary to hold referendums.\"{0}Bolagria has been trying to become the sixteenth Soviet republic for a long time, quite probably because of its debt to the USSR, but now a referendum has been held in the country and {1}% of citizens voted \"FOR\" joining the USSR.{0}Mongolia has long been the \"most disenfranchised socialist country\", where a separate group of Soviet troops was not even created, and the garrison stationed belonged to the Trans-Baikal Military District. Not surprisingly, {2}% voted for joining the Soviet Union.{0}Much more serious problems were in the \"rebellious\" Poland, which had already lost its statehood several times. Nothing new happened this time, because {3}% of Polish citizens voted for joining the USSR as a Soviet republic.{0}What happened, why it happened is an open question. The USA and Western countries accused the USSR of annexing these countries and falsifying referendums. The Soviet Union responded by accusing the West of hypocrisy.{0}But how should we react if now our border with the Soviet Union has increased many times?\r\nWhat will happen next...\r\nCondemn the Soviet expansion!\r\nThe Soviet Union has come to the final realization of its neo-imperial project...\r\n“The expansion of the USSR is a direct act of aggression against China, this is the way to escalate the conflict on the Soviet-Chinese border. We do not recognize the so-called \"referendums\" held in these three countries,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. {0}Andrei Gromyko, head of Soviet foreign policy, in his response called China \"a prison of peoples, where any desire for independence is brutally suppressed by repressive measures.\"\r\nтекст 3\r\nThe left-wing radicals are not in the lead...\r\nThe second Daman conflict\r\nChina\r\nUSSR\r\nAfter prolonged clashes over the island, Soviet troops stopped trying to defend Tarabarov and Bolshoi Ussuriysky Islands. Grigory Romanov stated that \"the Chinese lost more people this time than in 1934-1935 years in the Long March, and all this for a tiny island with an area of less than a kilometer. They have achieved what they wanted, but we will not ruin our soldiers for such a trifle.\"{0}We can assume that China has probably won in this unequal battle... \r\nAfter prolonged clashes, we had to stop trying to take Tarabarov and Bolshoi Ussuriysky Islands. Grigory Romanov stated that \"the Chinese lost more people this time than in 1934-1935 years in the Long March, and all this for a tiny island with an area of less than a kilometer. However, our brave soldiers defended the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union. We will not give them an inch of land, even if they invade for the third time!\".\r\nThe war is already underway!\r\nTarabarov and Bolshoi Ussuriysky Islands are already ours!\r\nPresident <color=#0027FF>Valerie Giscard d'Estaing</color> promises to ensure the implementation of the liberal program of the program - further liberalization of domestic politics and the economy, the reintegration of France into NATO structures and pro-European foreign policy, support for friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The first thing the president did was to dissolve parliament and call new elections, which the Democrats are expected to win. \r\nPresident <color=#006400>Francois Mitterrand</color> promises to ensure the implementation of the socialist program - to nationalize large enterprises, decentralize state power, shorten the working week, lower the retirement age and expand social benefits. The first thing the president did was to dissolve parliament and call new elections, which the left is expected to win. \r\nThe President of <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchet</color> promises to ensure the implementation of the Eurocommunist program - to nationalize large enterprises, decentralize state power, shorten the working week, lower the retirement age and expand social benefits. The first thing the president did was to dissolve parliament and call new elections, which the left is expected to win. \r\nPresident <color=#000080>Jacques Chirac</color> promises to ensure the implementation of the Gaullist program - the privatization of state-owned enterprises, national independence in foreign policy, the strengthening of the political institutions of the 5th republic. The first thing the president did was to dissolve parliament and call new elections, which are expected to be won by the right. \r\nThe collapse of globalism?\r\nThe socialist government of France has been pursuing a Keynesian economic policy for two years, which consists in maintaining a stimulating fiscal and monetary policy. Nevertheless, the reforms stalled, back in the summer of 1982, the French president announced a \"pause in reforms\" (using the dictum of Leon Blum) so that the budget could \"digest\" such a rapid jump in public spending. The main tasks of the government, which it set in 1981, still remain in \"limbo\": each price freeze is followed by another jump in inflation, unemployment does not fall, and the budget deficit is rapidly increasing due to rising costs. The problem is aggravated by the fact that the Bank of France is tied by external restrictions imposed by the structures of the European monetary System.The Socialists are divided into two factions on this issue: the first propose to implement an expensive policy with a high deficit and France's withdrawal from the European Monetary System (supported by Pierre Beregovois, Laurent Fabius and Jean-Pierre Chevenman), the second - abandon the socialist program and switch to austerity while keeping France in European structures (Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, Minister of Economy and Finance Jacques Delors).{0}This discord opens up some scope for our intervention, although it is obvious that it will have only an indirect impact on the decision-making.\r\nSupport the Globalists ({1}: - 15.0)\r\nSupport the anti-globalists ({1}: - 15.0)\r\nDo nothing\r\nFrench President <color=#006400>Francois Mitterrand</color> announces the transition to a \"strict regime\" in fiscal policy: public spending should be reduced by 15 billion. francs, new taxes and excise taxes will be introduced.{0}The abrupt upheaval in socio-economic policy disappointed the left electorate, which saw in <color=#006400>Francois Mitterrand</color> and the government of Pierre Mauroy a project to implement a non-capitalist path of development, an alternative to liberalism, which could resume economic growth after the crisis of 1979.{0}In protest, the Communists left the government.\r\nFrench President <color=#006400>Francois Mitterrand</color> announces the transition to the \"second stage of socialist reforms\". France announced the reduction of its participation in the programs of the European Monetary System and the Economic Community, whose policy \"contradicts the principles and objectives of the socio-economic development of the state.\"{0}Discussions have resumed on the creation of an education reform that should unite public and private educational institutions, the second round of nationalization of large enterprises has begun, new \"solidarity taxes\" on large property and high incomes have been introduced.\r\nRed turn?\r\nIn the last parliamentary elections of 1981 in France, the left-wing coalition won by a large margin. <color=#006400>Socialists</color> received {1}% of the vote, and <color=#8B0000>communists</color> - {2}%. Thus, the president of <color=#8B0000> Georges Marche</color> had to work with a multi-party government, and his party occupied only the portfolios of the ministries of economy, education, industry and a number of secondary positions. The government was headed by <color=#006400>socialist Michel Rocard</color>.{0}In two years, the socialist government initiated a number of radical reforms: a law on education was prepared, key sectors of the economy were nationalized, social reforms were carried out in the Keynesian spirit. Nevertheless, the reformers faced obstacles in the form of constraints of European structures, which are built on liberal economic doctrines that constrain the actions of the Bank of France.{0}It should be borne in mind that the right could not accept their defeat and react to any radical decision of the government by mobilizing the electorate and protests. The nationalization of industry and banks led to an outflow of capital and a decrease in tax receipts.{0}The problem is also aggravated by the split in the <color=#8B0000>French Communist Party</color>. After switching to Eurocommunist positions, distancing from the USSR and abandoning the thesis of the dictatorship of the proletariat, three wings were formed in the party - Orthodox (for returning to the roots), Eurocommunists (inclusion in the European communist trend) and reformers (reforming the communist Party into a left-socialist one).{0}It is difficult to say whether <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchais</color> will be able to fulfill his election promises and build democratic socialism in France, but numerous circumstances suggest that the balance of power is not changing in his favor.\r\nTo offer financial and agent assistance in exchange for the return of the thesis of the dictatorship of the proletariat and withdrawal from NATO and the EU\r\nSuggest to the March to strengthen contacts with COMECON\r\nReformers and liberals should not lead...\r\nThe Extraordinary Congress of <color=#8B0000>FCP</color> condemned the group of reformers and voted \"for\" a return to the thesis of the dictatorship of the proletariat by a majority vote.{0}The fact of this was interpreted by the right as a call for a communist revolution, nevertheless, the president <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchais</color> said that he was \"the president of the nation, not of the party\" and therefore \"the decisions of the party should not be equated with the decision of the state\".{0}After that, the president announced the beginning of the second stage of reforms - France announced the reduction of its participation in the programs of the European Monetary System and the economic community, the policy of which \"contradicts the principles and objectives of the socio-economic development of the state.\" The French leader also announced a law on foreign policy neutrality, according to which France also leaves the military structures of the North Atlantic Alliance.{0}The sharp radicalization of reforms and the rejection of the Euro-Atlantic course caused discontent in the <color=#006400>Socialist Party</color>, which put forward a vote lack of confidence in the government in parliament.{0}France is closer than ever to a political crisis.\r\nThe Extraordinary Congress of <color=#8B0000>FCP</color> condemned the group of reformers and voted \"for\" a return to the thesis of the dictatorship of the proletariat by a majority vote.{0}The fact of this was interpreted by the right as a call for a communist revolution, nevertheless, the president <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchais</color> said that he is \"the president of the nation, not of the party\" and therefore \"the decisions of the party should not be equated with the decision of the state.\"{0}The sharp radicalization of reforms and the rejection of the Euro-Atlantic course caused discontent in <color=#006400>Socialist Party</color>, which put forward a vote of no confidence in the government in parliament.{0}The government resigned, the President was forced to announce new elections to the National Assembly, which were won by the right, the government was headed by Gaullist <color=#000080>Jacques Chirac</color>. The period of \"cohabitation\" of the left president and the right prime minister begins...\r\nPresident <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchais</color> announced the start of the second stage of reforms - France announced the reduction of its participation in the programs of the European Monetary System and the Economic Community, the policy of which \"contradicts the principles and objectives of the socio-economic development of the state.\" The French leader also announced a law on expanding trade and economic ties with third world countries and the CMEA.{0}Socialists and right-wingers perceived this policy as a rejection of the Euro-Atlantic course. However, some of the left members of the <color=#006400>Socialist Party</color> support the course of the government, which makes it possible to keep the left majority in the National Assembly.\r\nAn attempt by <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchais</color> to pursue an anti-globalization policy towards the EEC and the Monetary Fund failed. The majority of socialists and rightists voted no confidence in the socialist government, which had to resign. The President was forced to announce new elections to the National Assembly, which were won by the right, the government was headed by Gaullist <color=#000080>Jacques Chirac</color>. The period of \"cohabitation\" of the left president and the right prime minister begins...\r\nThe President, under pressure from the protests, was forced to announce new elections to the National Assembly, which were won by the right. The government was headed by Gaullist <color=#000080>Jacques Chirac</color>, who announced the start of re-privatization and the need for reforms in the political institutions of the Fifth Republic. The period of \"cohabitation\" of the left president and the right prime minister begins...\r\nLead 70s\r\nThe political situation in Italy in the 1970s became seriously aggravated. Unresolved socio-economic issues have led to a growing distrust of democratic institutions - radical terrorist groups of ultra-left and far right have begun to appear throughout the country.{0}The situation is no better in the sphere of legal politics. The strongest left party is the <color=#8B0000>Italian Communist Party</color>, which since 1972 has been headed by <color=#8B0000>Enrico Berlinguer</color>, who put forward a strategy of \"historical compromise\" - in the face of the threat of a pro-fascist coup, it is necessary fight for the preservation of democracy. Thus, <color=#8B0000>Enrico Berlinguer</color> gave a signal to other parliamentary parties - <color=#006400>Italian Socialist Party</color> and, in particular, <color=#0027FF>Christian Democratic Party</color> led by <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color> on the need to unite efforts and create a government of national trust, where all political forces will be represented.{0}Eurocommunist platform of the leader <color=#8B0000>ICP</color>, coupled with distancing from the USSR, brought <color=#8B0000>communists</color> the best result in parliamentary elections - 34% (7% more than in the previous ones) against 38% for <color=#0027FF>Christian Democrats </color>. However, the <color=#8B0000>ICP</color> proposal was completely ignored by other parties under various pretexts - from accusations of ties with Moscow to excessive dogmatism.{0}Another significant force in parliament is <color=#8B4513>Italian social movement</color>, which, despite being true to the ideals of fascism, positions itself as a pro-parliamentary party.{0}Instability in Italian domestic politics opens up opportunities for us to intervene - but who better to support?\r\nEstablish connections with ultra-left organizations ({0}: - 3.0, {1}: - 4.0)\r\nEstablish connections with far-right organizations ({0}: - 3.0, {1}: - 4.0)\r\nEstablish connections with all terrorist organizations ({0}: - 6.0, {1}: - 8.0)\r\nKeep out\r\nWe have established links with some left-wing terrorist organizations, including the most numerous - <color=#8B0000>Red Brigades</color>, which aim at «a concentrated strike at the very heart of the State, because the State is an imperialist association of transnational corporations».\r\nWe have established links with some right-wing terrorist organizations, including the most numerous - <color=#8B4513>Revolutionary Armed Cells</color>, whose ideology is to replace neo-fascism and anarchism.\r\nWe have established links with various left-wing and right-wing terrorist organizations, including <color=#8B0000>Red Brigades</color>, which aim to \"concentrate strikes at the very heart of the State, because the State is an imperialist association of transnational corporations\" and <color=#8B4513>Revolutionary armed cells</color> whose ideology is to replace neo-fascism and anarchism. It remains to understand - why did we do it? I hope time will tell...\r\nIt is still difficult to say where this political instability will lead Italy.\r\nEnd of historic compromise?\r\nRecently, ex-premier and leader of <color=#0027FF>CDA Aldo Moro</color> was kidnapped in Rome, not far from his home, {1}. <color=#0027FF>Moro</color>, being one of the most authoritative leaders of the <color=#0027FF>CDA</color>, supported the idea of a \"historic compromise\", on that day he was heading to a key meeting of Parliament, where he intended to put forward their plan to form a government of national unity in Italy, headed by the current head of government <color=#0027FF>Andreotti</color> and with the participation of <color=#8B0000>communists</color>.{0}Nevertheless, the radicals managed to instigate car accident, neutralize the protection of the ex-premier and take him prisoner. In their appeal, they demanded the extradition of several captured terrorists in exchange for <color=#0027FF>Moro</color>.{0}Most of the parliamentary parties were against negotiations with the terrorists, as they would \"compromise the political institutions of Italy\". Only the leader of the <color=#006400>Italian Socialist Party Bettino Craxi</color> called for negotiations in order to save the ex-premier's life.{0}Many politicians from other countries, the Pope and the UN Secretary General called on the terrorists to release <color=#0027FF>Moro</color>.\r\nultra-left grouping <color=#8B0000>\"Red Brigades\"</color>\r\nfar-right group <color=#8B4513>\"Revolutionary Armed Cells\"</color>\r\nWe don't interfere\r\nPacify the radical left and force the ex-premier to be released ({1}: - 9.0)\r\nPacify the right-wing radicals and force the release of the ex-premier ({1}: - 9.0)\r\nIn one of their latest communiqués, <color=#8B0000>The Red Brigades</color> reported that ex-premier <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color> had been sentenced to death by a people's tribunal.

The murder of right-wing radicals <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color> led to a drop in the popularity of right-wing movements, but the expected compromise between <color=#8B0000>ICP</color> and <color=#0027FF>CDA</color> did not happen.{0}In early 1979, the government, without consultation with <color=#8B0000>PCI</color>, made important political decisions (on Italy's entry into the European monetary system, on the candidacies of heads of state companies, etc.). This prompted <color=#8B0000>ICP</color> to refuse to cooperate with the government and return to the opposition. The 15th Congress of the <color=#8B0000>ICP</color>, held in March 1979, called for the party not to continue to support governments that did not include its representatives. However, <color=#8B0000>ICP</color>'s ratings have seriously jumped during this time - maybe <color=#8B0000>Berlinguer</color> and his party have a chance to finally form a government?\r\nDuring the year, the political situation within Italian society has changed significantly. The assassination of <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color> by radical leftists led to a drop in the popularity of leftist movements, but the expected compromise between <color=#8B0000>ICP</color> and <color=#0027FF>CDA</color> did not happen.{0}In early 1979, the government, without consultation with <color=#8B0000>PCI</color>, made important political decisions (on Italy's entry into the European monetary system, on the candidacies of heads of state companies, etc.).

However, <color=#8B0000>IKP</color>'s ratings have seriously fallen during this time - most likely, the brilliant success of 1976 will not be repeated. \r\nIn the parliamentary elections in Italy, <color=#0027FF>Democratic Alternative</color> won with 31% of the vote, followed by <color=#8B0000>PCI</color> with 25%, followed by <color=#006400>PSI</color> with 16% and, finally, the crushing loser <color=#0027FF>CDA</color> with 15%. By entering into a coalition with <color=#006400>COI</color> and several minor parties, <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color> managed to form a government.{0}First of all, the Prime Minister initiated the opening of an investigation sponsoring terrorists, as a result of which it turned out that in the 1970s it was beneficial for the United States to create an atmosphere of chaos, tension and escalation of violence in Italy. It was proved that the <color=#8B0000>Red Brigades</color> activists had connections with the US special services, existed even before the attempt on <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color>, and the attempt itself was prepared by the USA to remove an inconvenient politician who was ready to ally with <color=#8B0000>PCI</color>.{0}The facts that came to light caused a resonance in the Italian public, and <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color> accused The United States interfered in the internal affairs of Italy and announced a reduction in Italy's participation in NATO programs.\r\n<color=#8B0000>Italian Communist Party</color> won the parliamentary elections in Italy for the first time with 39% of the vote. The second is <color=#0027FF>CDP</color> with 31% of votes, the third - with 5% <color=#006400>PSI</color>. Small left parties received a total of 6%, which allowed them to enter into a coalition with <color=#8B0000>PCI</color> and form a government headed by <color=#8B0000>Enric Berlinguer</color>. For the first time in the history of Western Europe, a communist becomes the leader of a state. <color=#8B0000>Berlinguer</color> promises to start building \"Italian socialism\" and revise foreign policy, in particular, agreements with the EU.\r\n<color=#0027FF>Christian Democratic Party</color> won the parliamentary elections in Italy with 38%. <color=#8B0000>PCI</color> worsened its position with 30% of the vote, <color=#006400>PSI</color> was able to get the support of almost 10% of voters.{0}<color=#8B0000>Italian Communist Party </color>, having critically analyzed its activities during the period of \"national solidarity\", came to the conclusion that at this stage, cooperation with <color=#0027FF>CDP</color> within the framework of such a broad coalition is impossible. Instead of the \"historical compromise\" formula, <color=#8B0000>PCI</color> put forward the slogan of \"democratic alternative\". It involves the creation of a coalition of left-wing parties that will seek government power not together with <color=#0027FF>CDP</color>, but in opposition to it. But <color=#8B0000>PCI</color> has practically no fellow travelers, due to the fact that <color=#006400>PSI</color> takes a sharp anti-communist position.\r\nDoes the horseshoe theory work?\r\nAfter the release of <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color>, the police set about cleaning up left and right terrorist groups. Due to such softness towards the government and the ex-premier, a split is also brewing among the radicals - the fragmentation of movements and the lack of a unified government are superimposed on the ideological contradictions of the right and left, which often turn into bloody clashes.{0}Nevertheless, now between two warring groups - <color=#8B0000>\"Red Brigades\"</color> and <color=#8B4513>\"Revolutionary Armed Cells\"</color> there has been a rapprochement on the basis of contempt for all current political parties and parliamentary democracy in general. It should be noted that Italy already had the experience of such a \"political surrogate\", where left-radical and right-wing radicals were combined - the ideology of Nazi-Maoism, which equally hates both Soviet socialism and Western liberalism.{0}Perhaps there is sense to intervene to expand our influence in Europe? But what could it lead to...\r\nContribute to the unification of left and right terrorist groups ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 15.0)\r\nDo nothing\r\nThe first step has been taken - our agents managed to organize a meeting between the leaders of <color=#8B0000>\"Red Brigades\"</color> and <color=#8B4513>\"Armed Revolutionary Cells\"</color>. As a result, the program \"Young Europe\" was adopted, the purpose of which is the destruction of the \"Yalta predators and the liberation of Italy.\" The merger of the governing bodies of the radicals, terrorist cells and army factions has led to the fact that the organizations as a whole in Italy number over 25 thousand people. But now, if we want to achieve more - we need to continue to support them, because the police and the army of Italy are waging a merciless war of annihilation with the radicals. \r\nThe Italian police continue to clean up terrorist organizations. Recently, the leaders of the radical left <color=#8B0000>\"Red Brigades\"</color> and the right-wing radical <color=#8B4513>\"Revolutionary Armed Cells\"</color> were arrested, and their fighting wings were defeated.\r\nNazi-Maoist revolution\r\nAfter the unification of radical terrorist organizations into a single network, Italy was covered by a wave of anarchy. The police and the army could not cope with the onslaught of the city guerrillas <color=#8B0000>\"Red Brigades\"</color> and <color=#8B4513>\"Revolutionary Armed Cells\"</color>. The political crisis was exacerbated by the flight of young people (mostly unemployed) to radical organizations.{0}At this time, the superpowers are advancing their interests - the United States is inciting the right in parliament and the army to a coup d'etat, and the USSR - to a ruthless fight against terrorism and the creation of a unified government from of all parties, which will legitimize state institutions and strengthen control over the country.{0}Nevertheless, the strengthened Nazi-Maoist army, not without our help, prepared a plan for an uprising in some regions over which the government is rapidly losing control. The Nazi-Maoist revolution is close to its end, but how will the superpowers react to a virtual civil war in a European country?\r\nWar is hell? \r\nThe uprising is gaining momentum and it seems that the radicals are not going to give up so easily. The United States and the USSR issued a call for a democratic government to suppress the uprising of terrorists. Martial law has been introduced in Italy.\r\nRadical uprising in Italy\r\nRadicals\r\nGovernment\r\nDuring the uprising, the rebel managed to occupy several strategic cities in Northern Italy and blockade Rome. Government attempts to regain control proved futile, and as a result, the National Maoist army triumphantly entered Rome. structures.{0}The regime's legitimacy is practically zero, and even now the pro-democracy troops of the overthrown government are trying to organize resistance to the new regime. All major world countries did not recognize the result of the coup d'état.\r\nThe Italian army was able to stop the attacks of the rebels. The leaders of the radical left <color=#8B0000>\"Red Brigades\"</color> and the right-wing radical <color=#8B4513>\"Revolutionary Armed Cells\"</color> were arrested, and the paramilitary structures were completely destroyed.\r\nCrisis of the Italian Republic\r\nPeople's Italy\r\nAfter the assassination of ex-premier <color=#0027FF>Aldo Moro</color>, the Italian police launched a raid on the radicals, but the investigation led to unexpected results.{0}The police managed to reach unprecedented corrupt deals between the leading political parties in Italy and the mafia. In exchange for campaign finance, the governments of <color=#0027FF>Christian Democrats</color> and <color=#006400>Socialists</color> were revealed to have lobbied for mafia interests and patronized corruption and illegal dealings.{0}Scandal caused numerous checks: criminal cases were opened against many politicians, representatives of local authorities and entrepreneurs. The traditional political system is under threat. The leaders of the <color=#0027FF>Christian Democrats</color> and <color=#006400>Socialists</color> were arrested, and the parties dissolved themselves, their members flowed into the remaining parties that were not affected by the corruption scandal - <color=# 8B0000>Italian Communist Party</color> and <color=#8B4513>Italian Social Movement</color>, i.e. the political map of Italy has become seriously polarized.{0}Also, a reform of the electoral law was carried out - the proportional system was replaced by a majoritarian one.{0}In this situation, we can contribute to the coming to power of one side or another, given that early parliamentary elections will be held soon.\r\nSupport Left ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 10.0)\r\nSupport Right ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 10.0)\r\nAccording to the voting results, <color=#8B0000>Italian Communist Party</color> won the elections, having received more than half of the parliamentary mandates. Against the backdrop of such success, a government headed by <color=#8B0000>E.Berlinguer</color> was formed, which announced a revision of Italy's participation programs in economic and military-political unions. However, in the <color=#8B0000>ICP</color> itself, against the background of the \"arrival\" of new members from <color=#006400>ISP</color> and <color=#0027FF>CDU</color>, there has been a split, which may soon play a cruel joke on Italy's first communist government. \r\nAccording to the voting results, <color=#8B4513>Italian Social Movement</color> won the elections, having received more than half of the parliamentary mandates. Against the background of such success, a government was formed, headed by <color=#8B4513>J. Almirante</color>, who announced the revision of Italy's participation programs in economic and military-political unions. However, in the <color=#8B4513>MSI</color> itself, against the background of the \"arrival\" of new members from the <color=#0027FF>CDU</color>, there has been a split, which may soon play a cruel joke with the first ultranationalist in 40 years the government of Italy. \r\nSplit in the camp of the right\r\nAfter the corruption scandal in Italy and the victory of the right in the parliamentary elections, <color=#8B4513>MSI</color> was on the verge of a split due to different views on further reforms in Italy and the country's participation in European integration. There are several factions within the party.{0}The first faction is the \"pragmatic fascists\" led by <color=#8B4513>Giorgio Almirante</color>, adherents of Mussolini's ideas, who, however, recognize that it is impossible to return the past and must be fought within the parliamentary system.{0}The second faction is the \"popular fascists\" led by <color=#8B4513>Pino Romualdi</color>, a fan of the Republic of Salo and syndicalism{0}The third faction is the \"national conservatives\" led by <color=#8B4513>Gianfranco Fini</color>, who advocates social conservatism and parliamentarism.{0}In this regard, we can influence this or that faction, but what will be the benefit for us?\r\nSupport Almirante ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 8.0)\r\nSupport Romualdi ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 8.0)\r\nSupport Fini ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 8.0)\r\nThanks to our support, at the extraordinary congress of <color=#8B4513>MSI</color>, the faction of \"pragmatic fascists\" won the majority and <color=#8B4513>Almirante</color> remained the leader of the party and the state. Reforms were announced to support traditional values, religion, and economic cooperation between the classes.{0}However, whether the Nazis will succeed in realizing their program is a question that is perhaps difficult to answer now.\r\nThanks to our support, at the extraordinary congress of <color=#8B4513>MSI</color>, the faction of \"People's Fascists\" won the majority and <color=#8B4513>Pino Romualdi</color> headed the party and the government. It was announced about the \"beginning of a new national revolution\" and the creation of a new constitution of the state, which would secure \"the eternal union and harmony of entrepreneurs and workers for the good of the nation.\"{0}\r\nThanks to our support, at the extraordinary congress of <color=#8B4513>MSI</color>, the faction of \"National Conservatives\" won the majority, and <color=#8B4513>Gianfranco Fini</color> headed the party and the government. It was announced about the liberalization of economic policy, the legislative consolidation of the role of the traditional family and religion, the expansion of social guarantees for Italians. {0}However, whether the Nazis will be able to implement their program is a question that is now, perhaps, difficult to answer.\r\nIt was not possible to save the party from a split - at the next congress <color=#8B4513>MSI</color> - a significant part of the \"new arrivals\" left the party and announced the creation of the <color=#0027FF>Centrist Union</color> - a democratic party that must unite all political forces from the center-left to the center-right. The government received a vote of no confidence in Parliament and resigned. After snap elections, the fascists lost a significant part of the vote, while the new party, expressing the aspirations of the former <color=#0027FF>CDU</color> electorate, managed to gain enough votes to form a new liberal democratic government.\r\nElections in Italy - 1983\r\nDespite the success of 1979, <color=#8B0000>IKP</color> failed to fully realize its election promises due to an intra-party split over what is more important - socialist reforms or European integration? It was not possible to develop any intelligible position for 4 years, and real reforms aimed at a significant revision of the country's socio-economic development were not implemented. Over time, it became obvious that <color=#8B0000>ICP</color> began to lose the support of its main electorate - the workers, who, against the backdrop of the economic crisis in the West, were waiting for the communists to implement an alternative scenario.{0}Elections are already this month and it is not very clear whether <color=#8B0000>ICP</color> can hold its current position.\r\nAs a result of the voting, <color=#8B0000>IKP</color> received 33.5% of the vote, losing about 7-8% compared to the last election. Now, <color=#0027FF>Christian Democratic Party</color> has taken the lead again with 38%, as well as <color=#006400>Italian Socialist Party</color> with 15%, which managed to take away a significant part of the electorate <color=#8B0000>ICP</color>.{0}<color=#006400>ICP</color> and <color=#0027FF>CDA</color> formed a coalition and <color=#006400>Bettino Craxi</color> led the government.

Despite the obvious malaise, he continued his performance to the end, despite the fact that the crowd, after singing along with the choirs, shouted: \"Enrico!\" At the end of the action, he returned to the hotel, where he fell asleep on the bed in his room, immediately falling into a coma. A few days later he died of a cerebral hemorrhage.

There were several factions within the party. The problem is aggravated by the illness of <color=#8B0000>E.Berlinguer</color>, whose health was undermined by active ministerial work.{0}The first faction is the \"neo-Stalinists\" led by <color=#8B0000>Armando Cossutta</color>, condemning the Euro-communist course and being the most pro-Soviet among the leaders of the party.{0}The second faction is the \"moderate left\", whose leader is the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies <color=#8B0000>Pietro Ingrao</color>, who at one time called for the openness of the communists towards to the new left, but criticized the policy of \"market socialism\".{0}The third faction is the \"right\", led by <color=#8B0000>Giorgio Napolitano</color>, who advocates turning the party into a social democratic one.{0}B Because of this, we can influence this or that faction, but what benefit will we get from this?\r\nSupport Kossuth's faction ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 8.0)\r\nSupport Ingrao's faction ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 8.0)\r\nSupport the Napolitano faction ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 8.0)\r\nThanks to our support, at the Extraordinary Congress <color=#8B0000>PCI</color> the \"neo-Stalinist\" faction won the majority and <color=#8B0000>Armando Cossutta</color> led the party. <color=#8B0000>Enrico Berlinguer</color> left the post of head of government for health reasons, and the new cabinet was headed by <color=#8B0000>Cassutta</color>, which announced the beginning of the \"communist stage in the history of Italy.\" It was announced about the nationalization of large industry, the abolition of private property and the implementation of other socialist reforms.{0}However, whether the communists will be able to implement their program is a question that is perhaps difficult to answer now. \r\nThanks to our support, at the Extraordinary Congress of <color=#8B0000>ICP</color>, the \"moderate-left\" faction won the majority and <color=#8B0000>Pietro Ingrao</color> led the party. <color=#8B0000>Enrico Berlinguer</color> left the post of head of government for health reasons, and the new cabinet was headed by <color=#8B0000>Ingrao</color>, which announced the beginning of the \"socialist stage in the history of Italy.\" Industrial management reform, tax reform, and a revision of social policy were announced.{0}However, whether the communists will be able to implement their program is a question that is perhaps difficult to answer now.\r\nThanks to our support, at the Extraordinary Congress <color=#8B0000>PCI</color> the \"right\" faction won the majority and <color=#8B0000>Giorgio Napolitano</color> led the party. <color=#8B0000>Enrico Berlinguer</color> left the post of head of government for health reasons, and the new cabinet was headed by <color=#8B0000>Napolitano</color>, who announced the beginning of \"democratic transformation in Italy\".

Mondale is campaigning politically liberally, supporting the nuclear test freeze and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). He opposes Reagan's economic policies and is in favor of cutting the federal budget deficit. \r\nAfter the defeat of the Republicans in 1980, 2 candidates are participating in the new presidential election: Republican George W. Bush is an anti-communist hawk who advocates economic liberalization, an aggressive foreign policy and a conservative domestic policy.{0}His opponent is Democrat Walter Mondale, the current Vice President. President under Jimmy Carter. Mondale leads a political liberal campaign, supporting the freeze on nuclear weapons tests and the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) and advocating peace initiatives, coexistence with the USSR. \r\nWho will win?\r\nAs expected, the \"weak\" candidate Mondale lost to the \"strong\" Reagan, who ran his campaign cinematically. An increase in the production of weapons, an aggravation of the Cold War and further liberalization of the American economy are expected.\r\nAccording to the election results, 50.1% of Americans voted for Bush. The new Republican president promises to liberalize the economy, curb inflation and end unemployment, while resisting the expansion of communism.\r\nAs a result of the election, 50.2% of Americans voted for Mondale. The new Democratic president promises to pursue a balanced budget, increase social spending for the poor, and pursue a peaceful foreign policy.\r\nThe crisis of the derg dictatorship\r\nAs a result of the overthrow of the monarchy in 1974, power in Ethiopia passed to the <color=#2F4F4F>Provisional Military Administrative Council</color> (also known as <color=#2F4F4F>Derg</color>). Very quickly, all power in this collegiate body passed to one person - <color=#2F4F4F>Mengist Haile Mariam</color>, who launched a wide repressive campaign against his political opponents.{0}The new regime immediately began to navigate its internal policy to the Soviet model, however, it was not possible to carry out a rapid modernization of the country - the collectivization program led to catastrophic famine and hundreds of thousands of deaths. This is aggravated by the fact that this year the regime triumphantly celebrated its tenth anniversary, and this despite the ongoing famine in the country. Thus, the <color=#2F4F4F>Derg</color> regime is entirely based on military and humanitarian aid from the socialist countries. Nevertheless, Ethiopia became a foothold for the USSR in East Africa and the Red Sea, this became especially clear after the Ogaden War.{0}However, the most remarkable thing is the fact that the Marxist government is opposed by the socialist opposition: <color=#8B0000>The Ethiopian People's -Republican Party</color> in Ethiopia itself and various left-nationalist fronts in the separatist regions (the most massive in Eritrea and the Tigray region).{0}There are also significant forces on the right flank, primarily the anti-communist <color=#0027FF>Ethiopian Democratic union</color>.{0}However, everything is aggravated by the fact that the opposition is extremely disunited and is at war with each other (especially the regional one) and the government still manages to \"extinguish\" the centers of uprisings, but now that the dictatorial essence of the Derg regime has become obvious, the opposition points of contact emerged. \r\nRally and support the Ethiopian opposition ({0}: - 15.0, {2}: - 35.0)\r\nSupport Separatist Movements ({0}: - 15.0, {2}: - 25.0)\r\nSend aid to the Mengistu regime in exchange for withdrawal of the Soviet base ({0}: - 25.0)\r\nDo nothing\r\nRelations with the USSR should not be restored...\r\nShcherbitsky won't let us do it!\r\nThanks to our support, most of the opposition rebel organizations decided to present a united front against the regime <color=#2F4F4F>Derg</color>, united in the Revolutionary Democratic Front of the Ethiopian Peoples, which included even representatives of national separatist groups. Now the opposition has launched its rapid offensive against government troops.\r\nThe regime of <color=#646664>Mengistu</color> will not stand without Soviet aid, which will be seriously reduced if the <color=#2F4F4F>Derg</color> is taken out of control the coast of Eritrea, then the USSR will lose its foothold in East Africa. In this regard, we supported the Eritrean separatist organizations - <color=#646664>Popular Front for the Liberation of Eritrea</color> and <color=#0027FF>Front for the Liberation of Eritrea</color>, as well as <color=#8B0000>The People's Liberation Front of Tigray</color>, which managed to launch a new successful offensive.\r\nWe decided to go the easy way and agree with <color=#646664>Mengistu</color> to send financial and military assistance in exchange for the withdrawal of the Soviet naval base from the port of Massaua.{0}<color=#646664>Mengistu</color> against the background of the reduction of Soviet military aid willingly agreed to an agreement with us and initiated the withdrawal of Soviet ships from the Red Sea.\r\n<color=#646664>Mengistu</color> in exchange for further assistance from the USSR, he had to go to Soviet demands and create an Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist party \"according to the Soviet model and likeness\" - <color=#646664>Ethiopian Workers' Party</color>.

However, was this a noble act, given that such money is usually turned into a weapon against the insurgents? Nevertheless, both superpowers appreciated our peacefulness. \r\nDue to the fact that there was never any Trotskyist underground in North Korea, it was decided to invite various left-wing progressives from South Korea. In particular, the well-known labor activist and poet of the South Korean underground labor movement Park Nohae was appointed the leader of the new North Korea, and the government formed a small club of South Korean intellectuals called the Bolshevik Group. Unlike many other Trotskyist organizations, the Bolshevik Group evaluates the modern Soviet Union as \"the lesser of two evils\", \"undoubtedly a Bonapartist reactionary regime\", which, however, \"should be supported against the unipolar American imperialism that threatens the whole world\". The Bolshevik group also condemns the Hoxhaists and Maoists for \"exaggerating the danger of the Soviet regime to the whole world, thus belittling and covering up NATO's war crimes.\" Also realizing that North Korea after a long rule of the nationalist traditionalist regime is not ready to transition to socialism, the Bolshevik group is preparing to establish a transitional regime from a part-market part-state economy in alliance with trade unions and public organizations.\r\nUK Election - 1979\r\nThree decades of economic boom in the UK came to an end after the oil crisis in 1973, which seriously affected the economies of Western Europe. Attempts by the <color=red>Labor Party</color> government to stabilize the situation by continuing the Keynesian reforms. However, these measures were only partially successful and did not solve the structural problems of the British economy, the main of which are the lag in the introduction of new scientific developments in industry and the unprofitability of a significant part of state-owned enterprises. The crisis culminated in the \"winter of discontent\" when British unions challenged the government to push for higher wages, disrupting logistics and critical social structures in the country. oil and the problem of Northern Ireland), as well as issues of further integration of the country into the EEC.{0}A few months ago, Parliament expressed dissatisfaction with the government and it resigned, announcing new elections. In the British party system at the present time, three favorites have formed - <color=blue>Conservatives</color>, who promise to put an end to the dominance of trade unions, curb inflation and restore economic growth, <color=red>Labor</color>, advocating for a universal employment and progressive social policies and, to a lesser extent, <color=yellow>Liberals</color> calling for a revision of tax and economic policies. But who will win the election?\r\nAs a result of the elections, the <color=blue>Conservatives</color> received 13.7 million votes (43.9%) and received 339 seats in the House of Commons, securing an absolute majority of 43 mandates. 11.5 million voters (36.9%) voted for <color=red>Labor</color>, and they won 269 deputy mandates. <color=yellow>Liberals</color> got 11 seats. Thus, the <color=blue>Conservatives</color> had a chance to pursue their political course regardless of the position of other parties.{0}For the first time in the history of the United Kingdom, the government was headed by a woman, leader of the <color=blue>Conservatives Margaret Thatcher</color>. The new government puts the fight against inflation, the development of private entrepreneurship, tax cuts, the reprivatization of part of the nationalized industries, including the sale of state-owned assets for North Sea oil, in the first place in the social and economic policy of the new government. trade union rights. In addition, it is planned to introduce a regime of savings by reducing the cost of maintaining the state apparatus, housing construction, and health care.\r\nAfter the defeat in the 1979 elections, the <color=red>Labor</color> party began a crisis between intra-party factions, which led to the election of a compromise leader - <color=red>Michael Foot</color>. <color=red>Foot</color> being an ardent supporter of the Campaign for unilateral nuclear disarmament and the UK's exit from the European Economic Community (EEC), has brought the party to the brink of a split - some influential members of the party consider his policies in the party too radical and extreme left.{0}Also <color=red>Futu</color> on the right side is charged with inaction against the <color=red>Militant</color> group - a Trotskyist faction within the party, which, guided by the strategy of \"entrism\", wants \"Board\" the party and make it revolutionary.{0}But whether the party will be able to get out of this crisis and recover after the defeat in the parliamentary elections is not yet clear.\r\nWhat will be next?\r\nSupport coup Militant within the party ({0}: - 10.0. {1}: - 15.0)\r\nFaction influence too low...\r\n<color=red>Foot</color> failed to maintain the unity of the party - part of the influential <color=red>Labor</color> (\"gang of four\" - Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rogers and Shirley Williams, as well as Robert McLennan ) left the <color=red>Labor Party</color> and founded the <color=green>Social Democratic Party</color>. The latter, despite its name, adopted a centrist program and began to establish ties with the <color=yellow>Liberal Party</color>.{0}Soon, Trotskyists were also expelled from the party due to violations of the internal constitution of the party.\r\nAt the extraordinary congress of the <color=red>Labor Party</color>, the <color=red>\"Militant\"</color> faction, which has recently gained influence, accused the party leadership of indecision. So, <color=red>Ted Grant</color>, one of the theorists of the movement, accused the right wing of betraying the labor movement, and initiated their expulsion from the party.{0}Part of the influential <color=red>Labor</color> ( \"gang of four\" - Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rogers and Shirley Williams, as well as Robert McLennan) left the <color=red>Labor Party</color> and founded the <color=green>Social Democratic Party</color>. The latter, despite its name, adopted a centrist program and began to forge links with the <color=yellow>Liberal Party</color>.{0}Thus, the Trotskyist faction made up the majority in the party. The National Committee of the party was re-elected and included mainly representatives of the Trotskyist and left wing of the party - Taaffe, Grant, Dickinson, Walsh and Doyle. The party was led by <color=red>Ted Grant</color>.\r\nSplit in the Labor camp\r\nUK Election - 1983\r\nSignificant changes have taken place in the UK party system since the last parliamentary elections. The predominantly two-party system has seriously polarized, and another serious political force has joined the political game.{0}The popularity of <color=blue>Conservatives</color> is seriously hit by the heavy movement of neoliberal reforms, which are unpopular among the majority of the population. <color=red>The Labor Party</color> has been hit hard by a split and a serious lean to the left. <color=yellow>Liberals</color> and <color=green>Social Democrats</color> are nominated as a single list, having serious chances to overtake <color=red>Laborites</color>.{0}But the intrigue remains until last...\r\nThe <color=red>Labor Party</color> won the election. The <color=blue>Thatcher</color> foreign policy adventures dealt a serious blow to the popularity of the <color=blue>Conservatives</color>, and the failed economic reform - the failure of neoliberal doctrines.{0}<color=red>Tet Grant</color> became the Prime Minister of the country, who announced the beginning of a social upheaval in the UK, which will be based on a \"socialist democratic economy\". The government is already drafting laws that should knock the \"halo of holiness\" from \"natural property rights\", develop a program for the nationalization of large enterprises, the construction of social housing and the introduction of free social guarantees.{0}In the field of foreign policy, the Trotskyists declared the \"non-bloc status of Great Britain\" withdrawal from the EEC and NATO.\r\nThe <color=red>Labor Party</color> won the election. The <color=blue>Thatcher</color> foreign policy adventures dealt a serious blow to the popularity of the <color=blue>Conservatives</color>, and the failed economic reform - the failure of neoliberal doctrines.{0}<color=red>Michael Foot</color> became the Prime Minister of the country, who confirmed the intention to carry out unilateral nuclear disarmament of the UK and withdraw the country from the EEC.{0}The government also announced the start of a program of \"reconstruction of the welfare state\", namely the increase in public spending, the restoration of the public sector, the abolition of privatization, increasing taxes on wealth. \r\nNeither party was able to win a solid majority in the elections. However, as a result of the negotiations, a \"Democratic Coalition\" was created, which included <color=red>Labor</color>, <color=yellow>Liberals</color> and <color=green>Social Democrats</color>. The leader of the <color=yellow>liberals, David Steel</color>, who has already announced a revision of the country's economic policy in the direction of expanding social guarantees, trade union rights, but without carrying out nationalizations and privatizations, became prime minister.\r\nAs a result, despite the unfavorable economic situation in the country, the government remained in power for a new term. The \"small\" victorious war secured the <color=blue>Conservatives</color> victory in these elections. In total, 42.4% of voters voted for <color=blue>Conservatives</color>. For the <color=red>Labor Party</color>, the 1983 elections turned out to be the biggest defeat in post-war history. 27.6% of the votes were cast for its candidates, which provided <color=red>Labour</color> 209 seats in the House of Commons. For the Alliance parties, the election results were disappointing. 25.4% of the electorate voted for them, and they managed to get 23 deputies into Parliament, including 16 <color=yellow>liberals</color> and <color=green>7 social democrats</color>.\r\nFourth International?\r\nToday, British Prime Minister <color=red>Ted Grant</color> and the leader of the International Socialist Tendency <color=red>Tony Cliff</color> announced the revival of the Fourth International, a revolutionary Trotskyist organization created in 1938 and dissolved in in the early 1960s, of which the MST considers itself the legal successor.{0}The purpose of this event is \"the consolidation of all progressive forces for the revolutionary transformation of the world.\" In connection with the emergence of such a promising force, we can offer them our help and even revise our own ideology, taking into account how ideas about Marxism are changing in the modern world.{0}The spirit of October has dried up and we must go to meet a new revolution!

And very wrongly. Now the UK can become a center of revolutionary enthusiasm. Although the supporters of <color=red>Labor </color> are trying to carry out revolutionary transformations without the revolution itself, it becomes obvious. that the decline of bourgeois democracy in the West is near and its outcome depends on us! We must unite our efforts to defeat the serpent of imperialism for the cause of world revolution,\" was the statement of the Chinese leader.{0}The emergency Congress of the CPC approved a new ideological turn - all Chinese Trotskyists (Wang Fanxi, Liu Renjing, Peng Shuzhi) were rehabilitated, and the new party program consolidated \"the party's loyalty to the teachings of Marx-Lenin-Trotsky.\"{0}What will happen next? It's hard to imagine yet...\r\nI wonder what they will achieve alone?\r\nWe cannot come to an agreement with the UK...\r\nAt our call, British troops left the bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia and engaged in battle with Turkish troops, declaring war on the \"Turkish fascist regime\". \r\nMilitary question\r\nComrade Chairman!

Thanks to this, we managed to organize control over the national armies of other countries at a higher level, which led to an increase in the strength of our army by {1:F1} points.\r\nWe conducted military exercises and increased the contingent of troops on the border with the Soviet Union, which alerted our \"comrades\" from Moscow. This led to a weakening of the influence of the USSR in the region.\r\nWe have conducted maritime exercises and increased fleet strength in the South China and East China Seas. This alarmed the Americans, who now fear China's growing influence in the region.\r\nWe will return to this issue later.\r\nAgent's question\r\nComrade Chairman! Our intelligence suggests that you consider some measures that will strengthen the influence of our alliance.{0}Firstly, by reorganizing the intelligence, we will put the intelligence networks of allied countries under vigilant control.{0}Secondly, we can use our intelligence to crush the opposition in the uncontrolled countries and return them completely under our influence.{0}Thirdly, our spies can steal technology blueprints from the superpowers, which will increase the power of our science.{0}What will we do this year?\r\nReorganize agent networks ({0}: - {4:F1}, {1}: + {5:F1}).\r\nCarry out an operation against the opposition ({1}: - {4:F1}).\r\nConduct espionage against the USSR ({1}: {4:F1}, USSR Influence: - 1.0, Science Points: + 300).\r\nConduct espionage against the US ({1}: {4:F1}, US Influence: - 1.0, Science Points: + 300).\r\nWe have reorganized all the intelligence departments of the countries that are part of our alliance. Thanks to this, we managed to organize control over the intelligence networks of other countries at a higher level, which led to an increase in their number by {2} points. \r\nThe coordinated work of our special services led to the defeat of the opposition in the following countries: {1}.

Party leader Kaison Phomvihan announced the expansion of ties with the socialist countries and the entry of Laos into the CMEA.\r\nThe United National Front for the Liberation of Laos, which includes various opposition monarchist and anti-communist organizations, was able to take advantage of the dissatisfaction with the PRPL policy among the peasantry, and several successful guerrilla attacks provoked an uprising against the pro-Soviet regime. A few months later, under the onslaught of the rebels, the capital, Vientiane, also fell. The leadership of the NRLP fled to the USSR, and the remnants of the army began a guerrilla war.{0}\r\nThe new government declared its loyalty to Beijing.\r\nThe new government declared its loyalty to Washington.\r\nUSSR is dissatisfied with our domestic policy\r\nThe other day, the Pravda newspaper published an article {1} that criticized Chinese domestic policy. There were no direct complaints about the country's leader, but \"growing anti-socialist sentiments\" and \"mass distrust of the party\" were noted.

Despite the withdrawal of Iraq from the organization in the late 1950s and the collapse of the British Empire, the alliance still retains its influence.

After the departure of the Iraqis and the return of the Al Sabah royal dynasty to Kuwait, ethnic cleansing was carried out in the country against Palestinians who sympathized with Iraq, as well as repressions against the traitor military who sided with Iraq.{0}After the de-occupation of Iraqi territory, the sanctions were not lifted. \r\nThe invasion of Kuwait caused unanimous condemnation of the world community. The USSR and the USA did not recognize Hussein's claims, sanctions were imposed on Iraq, and an international coalition was created under a UN mandate.

In the Revolutionary Council of Portugal, created in 1975, there were several influential groups, each of which saw the future of the country in its own way - left-wing radicals, right-wing radicals, moderate socialists and moderate democrats. The conflict between the very radical poles of the political spectrum of the military has led to several unsuccessful attempts at coup d'état and the so-called. The \"hot summer of 1975\".{0}The suppression of left and right coups led to the loss of influence of radical forces in the government, which carried out socialist reforms, and in a society that was tired of the wavering revolution. This significantly strengthened the positions of the democratic parties, which entered 1976 with full confidence that the revolution was coming to its logical conclusion.{0}In April of this year, a new constitution was adopted, which, nevertheless, consolidated the provisions for the construction of socialism in the country and the irreversibility of the expropriations of previous years. The parliamentary elections held in the same month were won by <color=#006400>Socialist Party</color> led by <color=#006400>Mario Suares</color> (35%), two right-wing parties (<color=#0027FF>People's Party</color> and <color=#0027FF>Social Democratic Party</color>) received 40%. <color=#8B0000>Communists</color> won only 15%. Presidential elections will soon take place in the country, where, most likely, <color=#0027FF>Ramalya Eanisha</color>, supported by the main political parties, will win.{0}However, the stabilization trend has not resolved the main contradictions in the development of the country – the situation for democracy is still unfavorable, and any, even the most insignificant shocks, can breathe new life into the revolution.{0}<color=red>If the stability index of democracy exceeds 50%, then a liberal regime will be established in the country</color>. \r\nUndermine the stability of democracy in the country ({0}: -2.0, {1}: - 2.0)\r\nDo nothing\r\nWe have supported radical political and terrorist groups that are extremely hostile to the current regime. During this month, they committed several major political actions - the assassination of the radical left priest Padre Max, explosions in the Cuban embassy, in the trade union department of the <color=#8B0000>Communist Party</color> and its regional branches. These incidents will clearly not work in favor of stabilizing democracy.{0}It is worth noting that the Revolutionary Council was not disbanded after the adoption of the constitution and continued to exist, remaining an advisory body that is above democratic institutions and still includes members much more radical than the representatives of the current leadership. However, will this cause further aggravation of the political crisis? It's not clear yet…\r\nWe decided not to do anything. It is worth noting that the Revolutionary Council, after the adoption of the constitution, was not disbanded and continued to exist, remaining an advisory body that is above democratic institutions and still includes much more radical members than representatives of the current leadership. However, will this cause further aggravation of the political crisis? It's not clear yet…\r\nNormalization\r\nThe situation in Portugal finally stabilized. Despite a prolonged economic downturn, inflation, unemployment and frequent government changes, the popularity of radical parties continues to decline. The pressure on the Revolutionary Council of Portugal has increased - democratic parties and the government have initiated public campaigns in support of its dissolution, since the council is essentially a body that stands above democratic institutions and impedes the development of reforms. {0}The new, democratic Portugal, headed for entry in the EEC and integration with other European countries.\r\nEstablish trade and diplomatic relations with Portugal\r\nNothing to do\r\nIt is known that Mao Zedong called Portugal \"a miserable little country\". Now everything has changed, China has established trade and diplomatic relations with Portugal.\r\nThe carnation revolution is over.\r\nNew carnation revolution?\r\nThere has been no stabilization of democratic institutions in Portugal over the past six years. Center-left and center-right governments have repeatedly replaced each other, however, none of the political forces managed to solve the socio-economic problems that the country inherited from the old regime, as well as finally close the issue of decolonization. Political instability added fuel to the fire - radical left and right forces constantly carried out terrorist attacks and other actions that seriously hit the popularity of the government.{0}Democratic politicians tried to unleash a flurry of public discontent against the Revolutionary Council, which \"stands above democratic institutions and impedes political modernization \". However, the military, despite the curtailed powers, successfully repulsed the attacks.{0}The position of radical parties in the parliament was strengthened. Under their pressure, the new military entered the RS, extremely negatively disposed towards the liberal policy of the authorities. Far-left politicians such as <color=#8B0000>Gonçalves</color> and <color=#8B0000>Zaraiva de Carvalho</color> have returned, as well as far-right leaders of anti-communist organizations <color=#8B4513>Alpoin Kalvan</color> and <color=#8B4513>Spinola</color>.{0}The Council is increasingly polarizing and radicalizing, politicians accusing each other of betraying the Carnation Revolution. Rumors are spreading in society that the military is once again preparing to take power into their own hands in order to restore order in the country. But which way will Portugal go this time?\t\r\nSupport Left Group ({0}: - 20.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nSupport Right group ({0}: - 20.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nWatch the situation\r\nNew coup in Lisbon! The government promulgated an act dissolving the Revolutionary Council. Under the 1976 Constitution, the RC can declare any act unconstitutional. The RS stated that \"the government betrayed the ideals of the 1974 revolution, stood in the way of the counter-revolution and sought to destroy the socialist gains of the revolution.\" The military occupied the main administrative buildings of the capital, and announced the overthrow of the government and the arrest of ministers, who nevertheless managed to escape from the country.{0}Left-radical and pro-communist forces supported the coup.

Of any significant countries, only the USA, Canada and Germany remained.{0}Today the North Atlantic Council decided to denounce the 1949 agreement establishing NATO. The NATO headquarters in Brussels was closed after the ceremonial lowering of the flags of the remaining members of the alliance. After this event, the United States withdrew from other regional alliances created along the lines of NATO.\r\nThe end of American hegemony has come!\r\nThe Cold War is over...?\r\nSunset of Europe\r\nAn attempt at full-fledged European integration, the creation of a single economic space and the creation of a confederate state on the basis of the EEC obviously failed. A significant part of the constituent members of the organization left it.{0}In this regard, the remaining European countries included in the community announced the denunciation of most of the agreements that were aimed at creating a single political, monetary, economic and customs space.{0}European common market actually ceased to exist.\r\nThe end of the globalist project!\r\nThe situation in Europe is approaching the status quo of the early 20th century...\r\nThaw in Spain\r\nShortly before his death, the dictator Franco appointed Juan Carlos I as his successor and king of Spain, who ascended the throne after the death of the caudillo. In 1976, he appointed <color=#0027FF>Adolfo Suarez</color>, one of the representatives of reformist Francoism, as Prime Minister of Spain. For several years, he has been liberalizing the political system: the Cortes Generales are being created, political parties are being legalized, and amnesty for political prisoners is being carried out.{0}Such a sharp dismantling of the main institutions of Falangism irritates the traditional stronghold of conservative-minded forces - the army. The faction <color=#8B4513> \"Bunker\"</color>, standing on the positions of hard Francoism, constantly attacks the Prime Minister for his liberal-democratic transformations, in particular, for the legalization of <color=#8B0000>Communist Party</color> during headed by <color=#8B0000>Santiago Carrillo</color>.{0}At the beginning of the year, <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> announced the holding of elections to the Constituent Assembly to draft a constitution. For this purpose, a party was created that replaced the <color=#000080>Spanish Falange</color> and united all the reformist forces - <color=#0027FF>Union of the Democratic Center</color>. In addition to the <color=#8B0000>Communists</color>, the <color=#006400>Socialists</color>, led by a young lawyer <color=#006400>Filipe González</color>, also came out of the underground.{0}On the right flank – two main parties: the conservative <color=#0027FF>Popular Alliance</color> (leader - <color=#0027FF>Manuel Fraga</color>) and the far-right <color=#8B4513>The Genuine Spanish Falange</color>. {0}Such a variety of political forces calls into question the possibility of an unconditional victory of the new party in power, since it is almost impossible to predict the outcome of the first democratic elections in several decades of a totalitarian regime.\t\r\nWho will win...?\r\nThe electoral campaign of the first democratic elections was extremely hot and competitive.{0}The current prime minister <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color>, who occupied the free niche of the “center” on the political spectrum of Spain, refused to participate in the elections, but the expected defeat did not happen - every woman in Spain received a letter in the mailbox signed by <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> with a promise to take care of her family. Both leftist parties, fearing the \"shadow of Francoism\", attack the <color=#0027FF>People's Alliance</color> with sharp criticism, which plays to the advantage of <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color>. {0}The election results were not shocking: <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> received 35%. The <color=green>socialists</color> have secured the status of the first opposition party very confidently, gaining 29%. Far behind these two parties, <color=#8B0000>Communists</color> and <color=#0027FF>Conservatives</color>, <color=#8B4513>Phalangists</color> did not get into parliament at all.{0}The radicals suffered a serious defeat in the elections: <color=#0027FF>Fraga</color> overestimated the conservatism of the bourgeoisie, peasants and the urban middle class, and the general secretary of <color=#8B0000>Carrillo's Communist Party</color> — the leftist attitude of the Spanish workers.{0}So far, all the real power of the voters belongs to the democratic parties, but will the passive majority be able to overcome the active minority this time?\r\nOperation galaxy\r\nIn most barracks of the army and the civil guard, in the secret services, in officer clubs and headquarters, in military schools, portraits of Franco still hang everywhere, to which portraits of the king have recently been added. However, portraits of the Prime Minister <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> are not hung there, as they consider him a traitor who legalized the <color=#8B0000>Communist Party</color>, seeks to return autonomy to the separatist regions and curtail the powers of the king. As a result, the army feels betrayed and insulted. {0}According to our intelligence agencies, a group of military men gathering at the Galaxy Cafe are preparing a mutiny for mid-November, when many Falangists gather in Madrid for the anniversary of Franco's death. Their goal is to isolate <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> and impose a new government on the king. But can they commit to throw the country back from democracy? Or are the consequences of the reforms already irreversible? The question is perhaps a difficult one...{0}{1}{0}{2}\r\nHelp the Separatists finish off the hated king ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 15.0)\r\nWe haven't established ties with the separatists...\r\nWatch the situation\r\nIncredible event! The royal plane had just managed to rise above the runway of the Madrid airport, as it was instantly blown up by a homing missile. The Spanish public is in shock and cannot believe that the symbol of democratization and liberalization has fallen victim to terrorists. Members of the ETA claimed responsibility, stating that the death of the king was only a response to \"centuries of oppression of small nationalities by Spanish tyranny.\" {0}For the military, this was the last straw of patience. They could put up with the legalization of communists and socialists, attacks on Catholicism, but not with the king, who was appointed by the caudillo himself. In the best traditions of the Spanish pronunciamiento, the military rebelled in the province against the democratic government of <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color>. Among the active supporters of the rebellion were many members of the so-called. Francoist group <color=#8B4513>\"Bunker\"</color>, which has opposed democratic changes over the past years, namely <color=#8B4513>Antonio Tejero, Blas Piñar and Jaime Milans del Bosque</color>. The rebels announced the creation of a \"National Government\" in Zaragoza.{0}Prime Minister <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color>, himself still an active Falangist propagandist, called the events an \"anti-democratic ultra-right rebellion\" and called on all major democratic forces to defend the freedom they had won. Influential representatives of political parties were invited to the “government of national trust”, incl. <color=#006400>socialists</color> and <color=#8B0000>communists</color>. This time, only a small part of the army joined the democratic government. As a result, <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> had to announce the complete mobilization of the population of the cities under his control to resist the rebels.{0}The superpowers that adhered to the Helsinki Accords, which consolidated the post-war Yalta-Potsdam alignment of forces, stated that \"the events in Spain - an internal affair of Spain\", however, it is obvious that each of the countries has its own sympathies for the current situation. \r\nSecond Spanish Civil War\r\nGovernment\r\nFalangists\r\nThe premier <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> was informed about the preparation of the conspiracy. However, he decided to act with restraint so as not to cause more discontent in the army ranks. Only two conspirators out of about two hundred people aware of the conspiracy were arrested. Among those arrested was Lieutenant Colonel of the Civil Guard <color=#8B4513>Tejero</color>, who has long been known for violent anti-democratic speeches.{0}The democratic camp is consolidating against the backdrop of a possible reaction of the Falangist forces. \r\nAlso, thanks to our contacts with the Basque and Catalan separatists, we found out that groups of left-wing nationalist organizations (Basque ETA and the Catalan Free Land) are preparing a grand assassination attempt - this time on the king himself! The separatists want to shoot down the plane on which Juan Carlos will fly to Mexico.\r\nI wonder what these two events can lead to if they are successful?\r\nThe bloody civil war in Spain is over. The democratic government, despite the military superiority of the enemy, was able to withstand the \"second crusade of Francoism\". A rethinking of recent history began in society - an attempt to simply delete the period of Francoism from Spanish history failed. The burial of the caudillo was moved from the Valley of the Fallen to the dictator's homeland, and open trials began against the surviving criminals of the first and second civil wars. Far-right and even conservative parties were banned.{0}The dominance of leftist views made it possible to restore the republic in the country and return the old republican symbols.{0}Despite all this, the question remains how and where the country will move in the foreseeable future.{0} {1}\r\nThe bloody civil war in Spain is over. The democratic government fell, the rebel troops managed to take Madrid. Severe repressions began against <color=#8B0000>communists</color>, <color=#006400>socialists</color> and <color=#0027FF>liberals</color>.{0}The military grouped around <color='s successor #8B4513>Spanish phalanx - National Union</color>, led by <color=#8B4513>Blas Piñar</color>. The national government curtailed all the achievements of a democratic government and began to return to the practices of phalangism: all political parties were banned, except for the ruling one, autonomies and the Cortes Generales were abolished.{0}After the death of Franco's henchman Juan Carlos I, the throne was vacant, so the military decided to to enthrone Sixtus-Heinrich of Bourbon of Parma, who is a far-right Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne.{0}{1}\r\nThe protracted civil war led to the understanding that it was time to end it. A number of more moderate generals who were part of the National Government launched a coup to remove the radical Falangists from power. And so it happened. More agreeable military went to an agreement with Madrid to end the fratricidal war and create a joint government to overcome the crisis, which was headed by General <color=green>Armada</color>\r\nSpanish Republic\r\nSpanish Falang\r\nThe democratic government agreed to recognize the independence of the Basque Country and Catalonia.\r\nThe democratic government agreed to recognize the independence of the Basque Country.\r\nThe democratic government agreed to recognize the independence of Catalonia.\r\nThe National Government, which adheres to unitary views on the structure of Spain, refused to recognize the claims of a number of territories for independence.\r\nElections in Spain - 1979\r\nOn December 6, 1978, citizens approve Spain's new democratic constitution in a referendum with a majority of almost 88% of the vote. <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color>, celebrating his triumph, closes the Constituent Assembly and calls new elections for March 1979 in order to receive a mandate of confidence for further reforms.{0}The election campaign is activated again: the most opposition party is once again <color=#006400>Spanish Socialist Workers' Party</color>, led by <color=#006400>González</color>. <color=#8B0000>Communists</color>, despite the promises of <color=#8B0000>Carrillo</color> that this time the people will definitely take into account the years of persecution of the party and \"vote correctly\", according to sociological ratings they will not gain more 10%. In the party itself, they are dissatisfied with the actions of the Secretary General - the pro-Soviet faction criticizes him for Eurocommunism, the Eurocommunist for conciliation with the monarchy and betrayal of republican ideals. Against the background of the young and energetic <color=#006400>Gonzalez</color> <color=#8B0000>Carrillo</color>, like the Falangists, looks like a “ghost of the past”, but, in fact, to overthrow and even more so to exclude a long-term leader <color=#8B0000>communists</color> for nothing. However, do professionals have their own way? Any obstacle can be bypassed, and if we want to increase our influence on the communist movement in Spain, then perhaps it is worth \"removing\" the unlucky old man? \r\nEliminate Carrillo ({0}: - 5.0, {1}: - 10.0)\r\nSensational event in Spain. <color=#8B0000>Communist Party leader Santiago Carrillo</color> was shot dead by a far-right Falangist during his election tour. The attacker was caught and said that “<color=#8B0000>Carrillo</color> is in the dock, but not in the parliamentary one.”{0}The public is shocked by the event. The king called the incident a \"crime against democracy\" and urged his subjects to consolidate against the backdrop of the threat of far-right revanchism.{0}At the post of Secretary General of the CPI, <color=#8B0000>Carrillo</color> was replaced by <color=#8B0000>Gerardo Iglesias</color> - his close supporter is a Eurocommunist.{0}The death of a well-known underground leader greatly influenced the mood of the public: <color=#006400>SSWP</color> is in the lead with 35% of the votes, the centrists <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> suffered a serious defeat color> who received 28%, <color=#8B0000>communists</color> take 16%. The representation of the right has seriously decreased, the rest of the seats were taken by representatives of national autonomies.{0}Despite a significant gap, <color=#006400>Gonzalez</color> failed to form a one-party government and had to create a coalition with <color=#8B0000>communists</color>.{0}The army and the rightists perceive the defeat in the elections as \"the death of the Motherland\", accusing <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> of betrayal and ties with Moscow.\r\n<color=#0027FF>Union of the Democratic Center</color>, which <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> put together from nomenklatura reformers and moderate oppositionists, wins the elections again, having received 34% of the votes. Next with 30% are <color=#006400>socialists</color>. 10% are taken by <color=#8B0000>communists</color>, the same amount taken by right-wing conservative parties. In the elections, <color=#8B4513>National Union</color> gets one seat and promotes its leader <color=#8B4513>Blas Piñar</color> to parliament. <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> heads the government again.{0}Such an insulting defeat seriously hits the <color=#006400>socialists</color>. Gonzalez comes to the conclusion that the conservative part of the electorate is frightened by the program of the party, which Marx himself helped write. In <color=#006400>SSWP</color>, shifts begin to remove the main provisions of Marxism from the program.{0}The elections themselves are very symptomatic - this is only the second free vote, with the exception of a referendum on the constitution, in the last decades, and the turnout has already dipped below 70%, even though the government passed a law lowering the voting age from 21 to 18. Isn't this a sign that society is \"tired\" of an unstable democracy?\r\nBreakup of Spain\r\nAfter the victory in the civil war, Franco decides to “punish” the former supporters of the republic in the person of national minorities and sets a course for the unitarism of the country: any autonomy is abolished, Spanish becomes the only language of office work, it is forbidden to write in Catalan and Basque in schools and the media. All this for a long time paved the way for the growth of separatism in these regions.{0}In the 1970s, the terrorist left-nationalist organizations ETA and the Free Land became more active, which created a headache for the Spanish government. Gaining autonomy in 1977-78 did not reduce the degree of unrest. In the elections in Catalonia, the left-wing parties gained a dominant position, and in the Basque Country, nationalist organizations.{0}Now that civil war is raging in Spain, the nationalists took advantage of the situation and declared independence. Realizing that the troops of both sides of the civil war would be ready to fight back against separatism, they formed national armies based on radical terrorist organizations.{0}The superpowers condemned separatism and refused to recognize the independence of both countries, but what will we do?\r\nSend military and humanitarian aid ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 5.0, {2}: - 15.0)\r\nRecognize Catalonia and the Basque Country\r\nCondemn separatists\r\nDo nothing\r\nBasque War of Independence\r\nBasque country\r\nGovernment\r\nCatalan War of Independence\r\nCatalonia\r\nWe sent humanitarian and military aid to the governments of the Basque Country and Catalonia.

The superpowers condemned our interference in the internal affairs of Spain.\r\n\"China adheres to the right of nations to self-determination. In this regard, we recognize the independence of the Basque Country and Catalonia,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. The superpowers condemned our statement as \"shaking the world situation.\" The national government of Spain launched an offensive against the separatists.\r\n\"We do not recognize the separatism of the Spanish territories and support the integrity of the country,\" - such was the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

A flurry of repression fell upon Catalan politicians, and the direct control of the government of Zaragoza was established in the region. \r\nCoup in Spain?\r\nThe popularity of the <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> government has fallen seriously over the past few years. The socio-economic situation leaves much to be desired, and the consolidation of political forces in 1977-78 in the matter of establishing democracy quickly gave way to mutual distrust.{0}Against this background, there is an idea to find \"one's own de Gaulle\" - a strong leader, a desirable military man who will rise above party strife and lead the country out of the crisis. Many, including the king, see <color=green>Alfonso Armada</color> as such a candidate.{0}The likelihood of such a scenario increased after <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> resigned in early 1981. Parliament refused to approve <color=#0027FF>Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo</color>, successor to <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color>.{0}The military, dissatisfied with democratic rule, are preparing a protest to take control of the situation in the country. <color=green>Armada</color> enters into negotiations with other military - more right-wing: the gendarme <color=#8B4513>Tajero</color>, who was released after his arrest in the \"Galaktika\" case, and the commander of the district of Valencia <color=#8B4513>Jaime Milans</color>.{0}However, forming a triumvirate, the three military men do not even realize how different their views are: <color=green>Armada</color> understands the irreversibility of democratic changes and allows the creation of a government from all political forces countries, even those of the left; <color=#8B4513>Tajero</color> - a supporter of the classical military dictatorship, orthodox phalangism, which was betrayed by politicians, the military and even the king himself; <color=#8B4513>Milans</color> is a representative of the pro-monarchist faction, who believe that <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> and the Democrats have taken away the king's powers, so it is necessary to create a genuine authoritarian monarchy.{0}However, the result the coup is still unknown, but we can contribute to the victory of one or another candidate for the post of the next \"caudillo\" of Spain...\r\nSupport Tehero ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nSupport Milans ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nSupport Armada ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nWe don't interfere\r\nThe second voting for <color=#0027FF>Calvo Sotelo</color> started at 18:00 Madrid time. At 18:22, a group of gendarmes of the Civil Guard led by Lieutenant Colonel <color=#8B4513>Tajero</color> appeared in the meeting room of the Palace of Congress.

At this time, <color=#8B4513>Milan</color> gives a signal to the Madrid divisions to storm the royal palace. The king is asked to sign a self-denial and immediately leave the country.{0}Thanks to military discipline, the capital was brought under control and a state of emergency declared. The deputies of the left and democratic factions were arrested immediately after leaving the Congress Palace. Tajero, at a meeting of the Junta, proposed to elevate the father of the deposed king Juan of Barcelona to the Spanish throne, bypassing which Franco put Carlos.

The king instructs <color=#8B4513>Milans</color> to arrest the instigators, which is exactly what happens. The parliament building is freed from the military. <color=#8B4513>Milan</color> speaks to the deputies and declares that \"in the current political situation, the nation must rally around the figure of the king - the guarantor of law and order.\" Under pressure from the army, Parliament appoints him Prime Minister of Spain. \r\nThe second voting for <color=#0027FF>Calvo Sotelo</color> started at 18:00 Madrid time.

The coup, which at first was doomed, was close to failure. After midnight, the king, in military uniform, went on television, condemned the coup attempt and called on the putschists to surrender.{0}The coup, which was supposed to legitimize the king's word, failed, and the instigators were arrested. The next day, thousands of rallies in support of democracy were held in the capital, and the parliament approved the candidacy of <color=#0027FF>Calvo Sotelo</color>.\r\nSpain joins NATO\r\nThe failure of the military coup, however, made it clear to politicians that the NATO military could be better than their own army with its class and phalangism. Leaders are beginning to change their attitude towards the prospects for Spain's entry into the North Atlantic Alliance. If <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> was skeptical about such a possibility, believing that neutrality would be beneficial to Spain, then his successor, <color=#0027FF>Calvo-Sotelo</color> made significant adjustments to the country's foreign policy. On May 30, 1982, the country was admitted to the Alliance.\r\nObserve carefully...\r\nHowever, the popularity of <color=#0027FF>Calvo-Sotelo</color> and <color=#0027FF>SDC</color> continues to decline. <color=#006400>SSWP</color>, which in 1979 abandoned Marxism and adopted the rules of the democratic game, have real chances to win the next elections. Perhaps the <color=#006400>socialists</color>, who had previously been extremely wary of joining NATO, will reconsider Spanish foreign policy?\r\nElections in Spain - 1982\r\nThe election of a compromise <color=#0027FF>Calvo-Sotelo</color> could not sharpen the further collapse of the ruling party. In August 1982, <color=#0027FF>SDC</color> left its founder <color=#0027FF>Adolfo Suarez</color>, who together with his supporters founded the <color=#0027FF>Democratic Social Center</color>. This led to the collapse of the ruling faction and the loss of the majority in parliament. As a result, new elections to the Congress of Deputies were announced.\r\n<color=#006400>Socialist Workers' Party</color> led by <color=#006400>Felipe González</color> became the absolute winner of the parliamentary race, gaining almost 50% of the votes. 4% voted for <color=#8B0000>KPI</color> under the leadership of <color=#8B0000>Carrillo</color>. Franco's fears that the legalization of <color=#8B0000>communists</color> would lead to their inevitable victory and anarchy did not come true. <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> and his new party received less than 3% of the votes, his \"brainchild\" <color=#0027FF>SDC</color> less than 7%. The <color=#0027FF>Conservatives</color>, led by <color=#0027FF>Manuel Fraga</color>, took advantage of the split of the center party best of all - his party, <color=#0027FF>People's Coalition</color>, received 26%. {0}In Spain, for the first time, a completely one-party government of <color=#006400>socialists</color> was formed, headed by <color=#006400>Gonzalez</color>. First of all, the new government announced the beginning of \"a period of reflection and the suspension of negotiations on the military integration of Spain into NATO.\" The authorities are going to hold a referendum on this issue, but after the putsch of 1981, the rhetoric of <color=#006400>socialists</color> on this issue has changed significantly...\r\nEuropean Socialist Union\r\nDissatisfaction with the neoliberal order in the European Economic Community led to the exit of a significant part of the countries from the union. Against the background of the significant success of the left in Europe, the opinion has strengthened that the economic, political and cultural integration of European countries should proceed on other, non-market and democratic principles.{0}Today, representatives of three countries met in Madrid - the Prime Minister of Italy <color=#8B0000>E.Berlinguer</color>, Prime Minister of Spain <color=#006400>Filipe Gonzalez</color> and President of France <color=#8B0000>Georges Marchais</color>.{0}According to the results of the meeting, “ Treaty of Madrid\", which served as the beginning of a new supranational European project - the \"Socialist Union\". Unlike the EEC, it does not involve the creation of a single parliament, but some kind of Central Committee is being created, which includes the leaders of countries and their representatives. Every year there is a \"changing of the guard\" - the presidency within the European Socialist Union. The economic basis is democratic decentralized planning with elements of state intervention and the private market. Such a model can combine the regional features of European economies. In addition, customs, migration and educational standards are established. {0}Isn't this the \"ghost of communism\" promised by Marx?\r\nSupport the formation of an alliance and conclude trade agreements\r\nCondemn the ideological narrowness of the union\r\nWatch the situation\r\nGreece and Türkiye apply to join the European Socialist Union\r\nGreece applied to join the European Socialist Union.\r\nTürkiye applied to join the European Socialist Union.\r\nAll countries pledged to leave NATO structures.\r\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs congratulated the countries on the conclusion of the new alliance and proposed to consider new trade relations.{0}{2}{0}{1}\r\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the \"ideological one-sidedness\" of the new alliance, which could lead to \"instability in Europe if other political forces come.\"{0}{2}{0}{1}\r\nI wonder how it will all end...{0}{2}{0}{1}\r\nSpain joins the EEC\r\nThe position of <color=#006400>SSWP</color> on the issue of European integration has seriously changed. If before that the party, driven by Marxist ideology, called such unions \"hidden imperialism\", now the <color=#006400>socialists</color> aim to join the EEC. However, the big problem of the current political situation for them is that they are in a coalition with the <color=#8B0000>communists</color>, who definitely will not take this chance. As a result, <color=#006400>Gonzalez</color> had to call re-elections to parliament, in which <color=#006400>socialists</color> received a confident majority.{0}After that, a referendum on the country's accession to the European economic community. Many political forces, including left and right radicals, urged to vote against. But what will be the outcome?\r\n54% of Spaniards voted in favor of joining the EEC. The country embarked on the path of enhanced European integration. To join the European Community, the Spanish socialists had to make ideological and practical concessions: the retirement age was raised, government intervention in the economy was reduced, independence was given to the Central Bank and social spending was reduced too, while all references to Marxism and the proletariat were removed from the party programme to accommodate the changes.\r\nGreat Britain applied to join the European Socialist Union.\r\nThe collapse of the Republican camp?\r\nThe former unity and political consolidation of the times of the second civil war came to an end. Elections have not been held in Spain since 1977. The composition of the parliament has remained unchanged since then, except that the right-wing and far-right parties have been removed and repressed. However, the balance of power has changed. Now each of the political forces has approximately equal influence on the Spanish public. The <color=#0027FF>Suarez</color> party is not very eager to hold elections, as they are afraid of losing their majority and losing control of the government. Nevertheless, a significant part of the bourgeoisie, after the defeat of the right, began to support his center party. <color=#006400>Gonzalez's Socialists</color> have moved considerably to the left. The influence of the leftist Marxists <color=#006400>Pablo Castellano</color> and <color=#006400>Luis Gomez Llorente</color> has increased in the elites of the party. <color=#8B0000>Carrillo</color> extended the influence of his party to the working class, but many recall his conciliatory stance with the monarchy, at a time when <color=#006400>socialists</color> stood up for the Republic.{0}Under pressure from left-wing parties, the government had to make concessions and announce the date of new elections. However, it is still unknown who can win. It can be assumed that the outcome of the vote will depend on the foreign policy situation. In this case, this opens up certain scope for us to intervene.\r\nSupport Сommunists ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nSupport Socialists ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nSupport Democrats ({0}: - 10.0, {1}: - 25.0)\r\nDo nothing\r\nAccording to the voting results <color=#006400>Spanish Socialist Workers' Party</color> won the majority of votes. <color=#006400>Felipe Gonzalez</color>, who headed the country, announced the course towards building socialism in the country. \r\nAccording to the results of voting <color=#006400>The Communist Party of Spain</color> won the majority of votes. Quite unexpectedly for everyone, <color=#8B0000>Santiago Carrillo</color> declared that \"the republic cannot protect the people's sovereignty from the encroachment of the bourgeoisie.\" As a result, a representative of the Carlist branch of the Bourbons, Carlos-Hugo of Bourbon-Parma, known for his leftist views, was invited to the vacant Spanish throne. Even under Franco, a left wing emerged in the Carlist movement, which put forward the paradoxical program of the \"kingdom of workers' self-government.\" Carlos-Hugo, who shares the ideology of Yugoslav Titoism, agreed with the proposal.{0}During the coronation, <color=#8B0000>communist Carrillo</color> knelt before His Highness and exclaimed: \"God save the king!\". \r\nAs a result of the vote, the party <color=blue>Suarez</color> again won the majority of votes. <color=blue>Suarez</color> announced the need to continue liberal reforms and further democratization of the republic.\r\nPeoples Spain\r\nSpain\r\nSocialist revenge{0}Filipe González and the SSWP managed to overcome the shadow of Francoism and reform the country. The socialists, who remained within the framework of the Marxist doctrine, were able to seize the electorate from their former coalition allies, the Communist Party, in the next elections, and form a one-party socialist government. Their main rival throughout the 1980s were the center-right from the People's Alliance, who, nevertheless, never gained more than a third of the votes. {0}The socialist transformations carried out made it possible to significantly democratize economic management: many enterprises became independent subjects of economic relations, especially large and significant factories and infrastructure organizations were nationalized, and small businesses continued to exist within the framework of the new economic system. The standard of living has increased significantly due to the expansion of social guarantees and the introduction of a progressive tax system.{0}In the socio-political life, there was a rethinking of the results of Francoist rule: if back in the 1970s various figures proposed to pursue a \"policy of national reconciliation\", then in the 1980s the socialists got revenge. A referendum in 1986 narrowly abolished the monarchy and returned the symbols of the republic, tried 1930s war criminals, and reburied Franco's body. In addition, purges began in the army from the remnants of the Francoists, portraits of caudillos finally disappeared from army structures... The socialists won revenge for 1936...\r\nSpain\r\nPronunciamento{0}The first few years of Antonio Tejero's reign were spent in a tacit confrontation with the king, which resulted in massive repression against the left, the imposition of a state of emergency in the country and, ultimately, the creation of an alliance of far-right parties called Juntas Españolas (JJEE) from the liberal-conservative People's alliance, the neo-Nazi CEDADE, the neo-fascist Frente de la Juventud and the neo-Franco Fuerza Nueva. At the first congress of the JJEE, Tejero said that the whole catastrophic situation in Spain is the result of the fact that the Jewish intelligentsia, communists and neoliberals took advantage of the previously inconspicuous shortcomings of the Franco regime and destroyed the country from the inside. And for the restoration of Spain, according to Tejero, it was necessary to formulate a new national ideology, taking into account the Spanish past and the mistakes of Franco's rule, as well as responding to modern threats. Under the auspices of the new alliance, the Blueshirts movement - the equivalent of the Blackshirts - was formed, consisting of right-wing youth activists who wore blue shirts and black berets. These activists, who received significant state allowances, began to physically destroy all opposition and anyone who, in their opinion, seemed even slightly oppositional. Terror swept across the country: most of the intelligentsia were beaten to death, as were many political figures who had not gone underground, and persons \"with a clear manifestation of Jewish blood.\" {0}At the same time, the new Tejero government began to crack down on drug traffickers, separatists and migrants, who were allowed to be killed on the spot \"at any hint of resistance\". At the same time, Tejero repealed the Moncloa Pacts of 1978, including the abolition of the progressive tax, the return of the permanent planned increase in wages for workers, and the restoration of the ban on businesses from laying off employees. The new reforms of the putschists were entirely focused on restoring autarky, protectionism, the police regime and providing work and a decent salary for every citizen. Racial segregation, the suppression of national minorities and the fight against Jews reached their climax and manifested themselves in a much more brutal format than it was under Franco, however, the foreign policy orientation has changed: Spain was ready to ally with anyone against world neoliberalism, communism and Zionism, and the new idols of this struggle for the new Spain were such people as Osama bin Laden, Slobodan Milosevic and the Taliban movement, with whom the new authorities entered into tacit allied relations, provided financial assistance and, on the basis of whose example, formed their underground neo-Franco organizations in countries third world.{0}In the end, by 2000, Antonio Tejero formed a new ideological concept called Pretorianismo - a corrected version of Francoism, where it is the army and the military that are declared \"the driving force of the national revolution.\" According to the new postulates, the state of emergency was lifted (excluding the Basque and Catalonia regions), the King lost almost all powers, the Parliament began to be elected exclusively from JJEE member parties, approved personally by the Prime Minister, who was now appointed by the General Staff from among its members. And the General Staff itself is formed from active generals. Both bodies, as expected, were headed by Tehero himself. And so Spain became a black spot in Europe...\r\nSpain\r\nloyal subject{0}Despite the success of his coup, Jaime Milans ultimately became only the \"wedding general\" of the new Spanish regime, voluntarily transferring power to the king and \"los siete magníficos\" - seven former Franco ministers who ruled the Popular Alliance party. The very quickly established regime was called \"overdue Francoism\" among the people: speeches about loyalty to Franco and his cause officially returned, the police regime was restored and punitive operations against the separatists began, although there was no complete rollback to Francoism - gradual privatization and deregulation of the economy began, budget cuts spending, tax cuts, and even limited freedom of speech and assembly was allowed, as long as they did not criticize the government and the foundation of the regime. In the political field, a \"temporary\" dictatorship of the \"government of national salvation\" was established: \"until the situation stabilized,\" elections were canceled and party licenses were suspended, and the right to appoint the Prime Minister and ministers passed to the king. In fact, the legal persecution of communists, socialists and their sympathizers who fled the country began, but politicians of a moderately right and even centrist orientation were freely appointed to positions of middle and lower levels.{0}Such a \"freeze\" and \"the Spanish path of transition to a market economy\" could not last forever: in 1997, Jaime Milans died, and on the day of his funeral, demonstrations took place throughout the country demanding the lifting of the emergency regime and the restoration of democracy. Then the king instructed the leader of the Popular Alliance, Manuel Fraga, to form the government, who decided to act immediately: by arresting and repressing the leaders and protest activists, Fraga simultaneously announced the end of the state of emergency and the holding of democratic elections. Taking advantage of the support of the king and the administrative apparatus, the People's Alliance, led by Fraga, received 40% of the vote and formed a ruling coalition with centrist parties. However, the vast majority of left-wing parties and politicians were not allowed to participate in elections or were even imprisoned, which led to the creation of the so-called regime. \"controlled democracy\" under the slogan \"We believe in democracy, but in democracy with order, law and authority.\"{0}Fraga's government deepened the program of privatization and deregulation, cut tariffs and completely opened the economy to foreign capital and goods, at the same time providing limited autonomy for Catalonia, the Basques and other peoples, accepting into their ranks moderate autonomists from representatives of these nations. Thus, declaring its commitment to democracy, carrying out deep economic and social reforms, the regime in Spain still remains authoritarian, Catholic and traditionalist.\r\nSpain\r\nSpanish de Gaulle{0}After coming to power, Alfonso Armada formed a government of national unity and began to implement a policy that political scientists called \"the ideology of authoritarian consensus.\" It was to find a consensus among the popular parliamentary parties while maintaining an authoritarian style of government and a strong influence of the army. So the Armada formed a government of the most flexible and pragmatic representatives of all forces - Gregorio Peses-Barba (SSWP) became Vice Premier, Enrique Mugica (SSWP) - Minister of Health, Javier Solana (SSWP) - transport, Jordi Sole Tura (CPI) - labor, Ramon Tamames (CPI) - economics, Manuel Fraga (People's Alliance) - defense, Pio Cabanillas (UCD) - finance, José Luis Alvarez Alvarez (UCD) - public works, Miguel Herrero (UCD) - education, Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun (UCD) ) - industry, Carlos Ferrer Salad (Association of businessmen) - trade. The government also included two generals - José Antonio Saenz de Santamaria (Minister of Autonomous Affairs) and Manuel Saavedra Palmeiro (Minister of the Interior).{0}Thus, focusing on the reign of De Gaulle, Prime Minister Armada began the implementation of new reforms - privatization and deregulation of prices and currency gradually increased, but at the same time social budget spending, the rights and opportunities of trade unions, standards of minimum social guarantees and the right of the state to interfere in the market grew. In foreign policy, Spain declared firm \"armed neutrality\" and \"primacy of sovereignty\", introducing these provisions into the Constitution.{0}At the same time, in domestic policy, with the consent of all parties, a program was developed according to which autonomies were only a legal formality, actually having only cultural and informational rights, and being severely limited in any others. At the same time, the government began to pay special attention to both the development of free education and the support and preservation of Catholic values. {0}Subsequently, the center party UCD lost its popularity, and many of its members moved to the People's Alliance, as well as ministerial portfolios. Similarly, following the UCD, the Communist Party also marginalized, joining the new broad-left United Left movement, under the influence of which reforms were carried out to reorganize the overseas territories into autonomy like Catalonia. However, the consensus continues to rest only on the authority of the Armad and his connections with the King and the military, and his death can change a lot. And he will die, sooner or later...\r\nSpain\r\nThe future of the country{0}After the victory of the SSWP in the elections, Gonzalez revised his party's attitude towards the idea of European integration and the inclusion of Spain in NATO. In October 1984, a referendum was announced on these two issues. The Spaniards approved the Euro-Atlantic course by the Socialist by a wide margin. Despite the implementation of some social reforms, Spain entered the neo-liberal globalist trend, which ultimately turned out to be a disaster for the socialists in the 1996 elections. This was also facilitated by the publication of a well-known newspaper about the existence of an organization, secret and outside the framework of the law, directed against the terrorism of the Basque separatists.\r\nIn 1986, after a referendum, Spain finally joined NATO and the EU.\r\nSpain joined the EU in 1986 after a referendum.\r\nSpain joined NATO in 1986 after a referendum.\r\nSpain\r\nRe-Carlista{0}The new Carlist rule began a reform in the spirit of their motto «God, Motherland, Liberty, King\".{0}In accordance with its first part - «God», all the prerogatives of the Catholic religion in society were returned, on the unshakable foundations of which the reformers wanted to encroach: Catholicism became the state religion, draft laws on divorce and abortion were abolished, the country was visited by the new Pope John Paul II, a well-known conservative and anti-communist.{0} equally represented in the political life of the country. Autonomy was granted to many regions with national minorities.{0} The «liberties» of subjects were enshrined in the “Royal Charter”, which replaced the 1978 Constitution, where the main provisions of the Age of Enlightenment about the inviolability of personal human rights and freedoms were fixed.{0} «King» - despite the seemingly monarchical principle, the separation of powers is recognized, but the monarch stands above them and has the prerogative to appoint and remove the government.{0}The traditionalist ideal of the Carlists was equally far from both constitutional monarchy and phalangist totalitarianism. However, in the end, in Spain, the «playing of the king» with all the accompanying ritual side and near-feudal knightly values became stronger as a state system. How harsh and merciless is modernity!{0}{1}\r\nSpain\r\nRevenge of the Republic{0}The significantly strengthened left wing of the PSOE, after winning the elections, was able to form a new government headed by Felipe Gonzalez, who began to carry out radical left-wing socialist transformations: the democratization of economic management, the promotion of trade union activity, the decentralization of management and powers. Key industries were nationalized, tax and social policies were revised.{0}Political reforms were carried out that seriously changed the political image of Spain - the liberal parties were actually taken out of the game, which ended up outside the new system, which was based on other, more democratic principles of interaction local and regional authorities, public organizations with a center. Thanks to this, the socialists managed to introduce elements of direct democracy as opposed to a representative parliamentary system.{0}The socialist ideal of the era of the Second Republic became a reality.{0}{1}\r\nSpain\r\nCarlism-Leninism{0}After the paradoxical proclamation of the monarchy by supporters of left-wing Carlism, radical syndicalist reforms began in the country, aimed at destroying the institution of private property and bourgeois relations. Inheriting the ideals of Catalan self-government during the First Civil War, the reformers led by Santiago Carrillo carried out in essence the program of \"monarchist Titoism\", which combined the traditional views of the Carlists (Catholic fundamentalism, anti-liberalism, the restoration of fueros - traditional regional liberties) and the ideology of Yugoslav Titoism, the basis of which was the idea of self-government of work collectives.{0}The implementation of the provisions of this, in many respects, eclectic ideology, was based on the fundamental work of King Carlos-Hugo \"The Carlist Way to Self-Administrative Socialism\". Rejecting all the political achievements of modernity, Spain, denying the results of the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution, returned to the near-feudal ideas of \"liberty\", which consisted in granting privileges and rights to the regions by the king.{0}In economic terms, the bourgeois idea of natural rights and inviolability was also dealt a blow property - the state nationalized most of the large industrial enterprises and transferred them to the workers' collectives. Despite the “diseases of Titoism” that came to light later, the subjects of the “people's king” were delighted with the radicalism of his reforms. {0}However, the uniqueness of this experience is undeniable...{0}{1} \r\nSpain\r\nDe-francization{0}Suárez's party continued its liberal and democratic transformations. Despite the initial conservative orientation of his party, after the civil war it turned to the left in political and ideological terms, but economic liberalism remained its ideal. The defeat of Francoism led to a fall in the authority of religion in society, so Suarez launched an offensive in this area, declaring the independence of Catholicism from the state and introducing secular laws that limit the role of religion in education, civil clerical work (marriage). In addition, abortion was fully legalized.{0}The new constitution of 1984 consolidated the principles of liberal democracy and a mixed market economy, along the way declaring \"a neutral and non-bloc status of Spain.\"{0}Despite the further aggravation of contradictions between Spanish entrepreneurs, investors and the global market, Spain was able to overcome the legacy of Francoism and build a developed democratic state.{0}{1}\r\nSpain\r\nSpanish de Gaulle{0}After coming to power, Alfonso Armada formed a government of national unity and began to implement a policy that political scientists called \"the ideology of authoritarian consensus.\" It was to find a consensus among the popular parliamentary parties while maintaining an authoritarian style of government and a strong influence of the army. So the Armada formed a government of the most flexible and pragmatic representatives of all forces - Gregorio Peses-Barba (SSWP) became Vice Premier, Enrique Mugica (SSWP) - Minister of Health, Javier Solana (PSOE) - transport, Jordi Sole Tura (CPI) - labor, Ramon Tamames (CPI) - economics, Manuel Fraga (People's Alliance) - defense, Pio Cabanillas (UCD) - finance, José Luis Alvarez Alvarez (UCD) - public works, Miguel Herrero (UCD) - education, Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun (UCD) ) - industry, Carlos Ferrer Salad (Association of businessmen) - trade. The government also included two generals - José Antonio Saenz de Santamaria (Minister of Autonomous Affairs) and Manuel Saavedra Palmeiro (Minister of the Interior).{0}Thus, focusing on the reign of De Gaulle, Prime Minister Armada began the implementation of new reforms - privatization and deregulation of prices and currency gradually increased, but at the same time social budget spending, the rights and opportunities of trade unions, standards of minimum social guarantees and the right of the state to interfere in the market grew. In foreign policy, Spain declared firm \"armed neutrality\" and \"primacy of sovereignty\", introducing these provisions into the Constitution.{0}At the same time, in domestic policy, with the consent of all parties, a program was developed according to which autonomies were only a legal formality, actually having only cultural and informational rights, and being severely limited in any others. At the same time, the government began to pay special attention to both the development of free education and the support and preservation of Catholic values. {0}Subsequently, the center party UCD lost its popularity, and many of its members moved to the People's Alliance, as well as ministerial portfolios. Similarly, following the UCD, the Communist Party also marginalized, joining the new broad-left United Left movement, under the influence of which reforms were carried out to reorganize the overseas territories into autonomy like Catalonia. However, the consensus continues to rest only on the authority of the Armad and his connections with the King and the military, and his death can change a lot. And he will die, sooner or later...\r\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia have finally gained independence!\r\nThe Basque Country has finally gained independence.\r\nCatalonia finally gained independence.\r\nThe situation in Spain\r\nNothing happened. Honestly.\r\nGorbachev dissolves the Warsaw Pact\r\nThe reign of the new leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, immediately began with a serious foreign policy defeat. Under pressure from the United States and China, as well as the European public, he had to agree to the proposed \"Unification of Germany\" plan, which did not even provide for its neutral status. Moscow's most devoted ally in Eastern Europe disappeared from the political map.{0}In this regard, the very existence of the Warsaw Treaty Organization was depreciated, especially after the Visegrad Group left the zone of Soviet influence. In 1985, the contract, concluded for 30 years, was to be renewed. Celebrations were planned, but they were cancelled. Gorbachev had to declare that this was just a “goodwill gesture” for the rapprochement of the USSR and the USA, but everyone understands that of Moscow’s real allies, only Czechoslovakia, which has a tiny border with Soviet Ukraine, and Bulgaria, which has completely lost its land border with the countries of the Warsaw pact.{0}The 30-year period of the Cold War is over...\r\nIs the Cold War over?!\r\nConservative-minded statesmen in the leadership of the CPSU considered such a “gesture” by Gorbachev a betrayal and a spit in the direction of the Great Victory of the USSR in the Great Patriotic War. Indeed, the creation of the world socialist system was its direct result. Nevertheless, so far no one is abolishing the CMEA, although projects for its reform are being prepared on the sidelines of the party, but will they be able to change the situation?\r\nPortugal\r\nNew carnation revolution{0}The leftist government of Vasco Gonçalves took into account the mistakes of the first carnation revolution and acted this time more decisively. This time, the “program for a peaceful transition to socialism” was significantly adjusted: instead of buying out 51% of the shares of enterprises, the Government announced the nationalization of key industries, transport and infrastructure. In addition, banks, enterprises of the electric power industry, oil refining, metallurgy, and railways become the property of the state.{0}Committees and commissions are multiplying at factories, construction sites, transport enterprises, educational institutions, offices and villages. They ensure workers' and peasants' control over production, profits and wages, purchases and sales, hiring and firing workers, and organizing workers' rallies in support of the revolution. The new committees have extensive powers of control over entrepreneurs and businesses, but lead to an outflow of the remaining capital and the flight of the businessmen themselves, which, however, only makes it easier for the government to expropriate property. {0}In the countryside, agrarian reform is unfolding with renewed vigor: not taken away in 1974-75. the property of latifundists and landowners becomes the property of cooperatives, and those created on the basis of Soviet TOZs.{0}One of the leaders of the new revolution reiterates that \"the establishment of traditional bourgeois democracy is not enough to satisfy the aspirations of the people.\" A political reform begins in the country, which seriously hits political parties, but the role of trade unions controlled and loyal to the government, socio-political movements and worker-peasant associations is growing. Introducing elements of direct democracy, the left radicals are implementing the position of democratic and decentralized socialism, which, of course, causes hostility among Western countries. \r\nPortugal\r\nNew «New State»{0}The right-wing military tried to use the rise of anti-liberal sentiment in Europe, as well as the fall in support and stability for democracy in Portugal, in order to recreate the \"New State\" regime. The military could not find the same \"titanic\" figure as Salazar, so they had to lead the strange collectively through the Revolutionary Council, which became the \"National\". Much in Portugal became “national” again: the only legal party under Salazar, the New State, returned from oblivion, but it failed to achieve the same greatness and significance in public life. Other parties were banned and turned to underground struggle.{0}The government by a special decree declared unconstitutional all laws issued by revolutionary and democratic governments in the period from 1974-1982, thus, the right sought to emphasize the illegitimacy of the eight-year rule and restore continuity with the \"National Union\". As part of the same ideological setting, Marcelo Caetano, Salazar's successor, who emigrated from the country after the events of 1974, was reburied in Portugal. In addition, the influence and significance of the Catholic Church and traditional family values were fully restored. It is noteworthy that the recognition of the actions of the previous government as illegitimate extended to the agreements on the decolonization of Portugal. Although they were declared invalid, no real consequences are being taken in the matter of recreating the \"Portuguese Empire\". {0}The ideas of corporatism, expropriation and nationalization once again triumphed in socio-economic policy. owners.{0}After almost a decade of democratic rule, everything seemed to be back in place, but how stable can such a fragile regime with weak ideology and legitimacy be, any minor crisis can cause instant collapse and hardly anyone will stand up for regime of the New \"New State\"...\r\nPortugal\r\nFuture of the country{0}With the dissolution of the Revolutionary Council, Portugal finally came under democratic rule. The influence of the military on politics ceased. In 1983, the Socialist Party again won the elections and Mario Suares again became prime minister. Soon, all provisions on the construction of socialism in the country were removed from the constitution. \r\nIn 1986, after a referendum, Portugal finally joined NATO and the EU.\r\nPortugal joined the EU in 1986 after a referendum.\r\nPortugal joined NATO in 1986 after a referendum.\r\nFrance: Friends Again\r\nValéry Giscard d'Estaing, after his victory in the 1981 elections, continued the previously outlined course of strengthening European integration and cooperation with NATO, while maintaining friendly relations with Moscow. In the economic sphere, the dominance of liberalism continued, however, a tax reform was carried out that increased taxes on business, efforts were made to increase the competitiveness of industry, provide employment, but most of the measures did not bring great results, and the French economy stagnated for the next 7 years. After the victory of the socialists in the parliamentary elections in 1986, led by Michel Rocard, d'Estaing had to «cohabit» with a left-wing prime minister who sought to pursue a more social policy. However, after the end of his second term in 1988, the Democratic candidate lost the election, losing the presidential chair to d'Estaing's worst enemy, Jacques Chirac. \r\nFrance\r\nFrom fascism to socialism{0}The François Mitterrand government was able to dare to go against the neo-liberal globalist trend and confront the structures of the emerging European Union. After France left the EEC, the socialists carried out most of the provisions of the \"General Program\" to be implemented. Social policy has led to increased benefits and pensions, reduced working hours, the creation of free systems of education and medicine, the construction of cheap housing. The democratization of the economy was carried out, the nationalization of key areas of industry and transport, labor legislation was updated. As part of the political reform, the powers of regional and local authorities were increased, proportional voting was introduced in the National Assembly.{0}Nevertheless, despite the confident successes of the socialists, the outflow of capital from the country increased due to high taxes and the threat of nationalization. The political opponents of the socialists, who have consolidated around the Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac, criticize the government for an excessively inflated budget and a fall in the competitiveness of French industry. were able to re-form the government.\r\nFrance\r\nFrom socialism to neoliberalism{0}The Mitterrand government was unable to withstand the pressure of the international conjuncture and the outflow of capital from the country, so it gradually began to curtail the left-wing Keynesian reforms. Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, who led a non-communist government in 1984, switched to austerity, pursuing an essentially neoliberal course. During the 15 years of his reign, President Mitterrand twice lost his majority in parliament and was forced to \"cohabit\" with the right-wing Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. In 1988, Mitterrand ran for a new term as \"the candidate of all the French\", no longer emphasizing the need for social transformation, which further emphasized the failure of his socio-economic policies in the first half of the first term. In 1995, his successor, Lionel Jospin, lost the election to Jacques Chirac.\r\nFrance\r\nForward to the bright past!{0}The new French leader, Georges Marchais, managed to crack down on his internal opponents and push the French Communist Party to the forefront of the French political arena. Having withdrawn the country from NATO and European structures, the government freed its hands to implement a full-fledged socialist reform program: the nationalization of the main industries, transport and social services, the creation of planning bodies involved in coordinating the work of the industry. implementation of the principle of \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", returned to the program of the party. Marchais stated the need for \"a review of the institutions of the political system, which is based on a representative system.\" A movement was launched towards introducing elements of direct democracy, increasing the role of trade unions and socio-political organizations. However, it has not yet been possible to really \"feel\" in practice the contours of that very \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", the first sign of which was the Paris Commune. Nevertheless, the main parties on the political map of France have become communists and socialists, while the right, after a series of laws that limit the sources of funding for parties and the media, are gradually losing their influence. \r\nFrance\r\nRising Star of Eurocommunism{0}The new French leader, Georges Marchais, managed to crack down on his internal opponents and push the French Communist Party to the forefront of the French political arena. Having taken the country out of European structures, the government freed its hands to implement a full-fledged socialist reform program: the nationalization of the main industries, transport and social services, the creation of planning bodies involved in coordinating the work of the industry. {0}In foreign policy, Marchais distanced himself from the influence of Moscow, while maintaining relations with other European communist parties within the framework of Eurocommunist politics.{0}In addition, the socialist government, paradoxically, imposed restrictions on immigration to France in order to stabilize the labor market, however, this negatively affected the overall economic situation in the country – The working-age population was getting smaller, and the birth rate remained low. Experts predict that the rapid aging of the population may soon lead to the fact that young people will only support pensioners with their labor, given that the communists lowered the retirement age.{0}After a significant subsidence in the 1970s, the PCF regained the status of the first left party, since in the ranks of the socialists after the defeat of Mitterrand there was a split, which turned into the departure of the left wing to the communists. There is also no consolidation in the right camp - the Democrats and the Gaullists were unable to nominate a single candidate in the 1988 elections and lost again.{0}It is rare to see the successful implementation of a communist, and even more so, a Eurocommunist project. \r\nFrance\r\nDance of the capitalist and the communist{0}The confrontation between President Georges Marchais and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac ultimately led to the complete failure of the provisions of the \"Common Program\" and the discrediting of the communist president. The next presidential election was won by Jacques Chirac, who finally dismantled the remnants of the social system, pursuing a neoliberal policy. The PCF, in turn, ceased to play at least a significant role in the political life of the country, finally losing primacy in the left camp of the coalition to the socialists. \r\nFrance\r\nde Gaulle's dream{0}Having proclaimed the restoration of Gaullism and ensured the real independence of the French state, showing all the people on the world stage the renewed greatness of France, Jacques Chirac was able to achieve such popular popularity that the French voted en masse for his party in the new elections, providing Chirac with the opportunity to create a monolithic government. And he took advantage of this by appointing his protégé Dominique de Villepin as Prime Minister. Having achieved exclusion from his own party of pro-Washington moderates, Chirac finally got the opportunity to realize all his ideas.{0}First of all, Jacques Chirac and his team announced the beginning of \"neo-gallism\": all state enterprises and shares were privatized, but together with that, laws were adopted to strengthen state intervention in the economy, in the monetary system, and even in the work of stock exchanges; a \"First Employment Contracts Act\" was also passed, allowing free dismissal of workers without explanation, but this was offset by a new government expanded social spending program that affected the entire population.{0}Thus, an unusual system of a purely private but regulated economy was formed with pro-employment labor code and broad social guarantees for the population.{0}The next president after Chirac was expectedly elected his successor, Dominique de Villepin, who, however, had to enter into an agreement with {0}The new Gaullist-Lepenist government in foreign policy continued Chirac's old course of cooperation with Moscow and Beijing and confrontation with the United States. Anti-Americanism under Villepin not only did not weaken, but even intensified. However, some changes took place in domestic politics: harsh laws were passed to combat migrants, radical Muslims, as well as laws obliging everyone to know French and profess only a secular version of Islam; at the same time, further economic reforms were the increase in the rights of employers while expanding the budget deficit due to large social spending. At the same time, the constantly growing budget deficit is covered by an active neo-colonial policy and a total siphoning of resources from the former countries of the French zone of influence.\r\nFrance\r\nGaucho-lepenisme{0}Failures in foreign policy and the failure to secure the promised full sovereignty lowered Chirac's popularity as a \"strong personality\" and coincided with the unsuccessful reforms of Prime Minister Villepin, who tried to significantly expand the rights of employers, which led to mass strikes and rallies of trade unions and leftists.{0}Even the Chirac own party was disappointed in his politics, nominating the extremely moderate and pro-American candidate Nicolas Sarkozy for the next elections, due to which most of the electorate, who wanted sovereignty and greatness, went to Jean-Marie Le Pen and his National Front party. However, within Le Pen's party, the idea that \"the national problems of France pass through the prism of social ones\" began to gain more and more popularity, which was called \"gaucho-lepenisme\" (\"left lepenism\"), which takes its origins from pujadism, anti-intellectualism, anti-corporatism and social state capitalism.{0}Jean-Marie Le Pen's aspirations to win both the right and the left electorate were successful: Lionel Jospin (with a program to make the right to housing an inalienable basic right of a citizen) and Jean-Marie Le Pen himself made it to the second round of elections. Unexpectedly, with a small margin of votes thanks to populist rhetoric, Jean-Marie Le Pen was elected President of France in the second round, but the parliamentary elections did not give enough results to the National Front for a majority. The majority of political parties took part in the negotiations.{0}Political tensions led to an unexpected outcome of the negotiations: the NF announced the creation of a coalition government with the Communist Party led by Georges Marchais. The latter confirmed this, adding that the coalition was purely temporary and was generated by the chaos caused by the results of the parliamentary elections. The official goal of such a strange coalition was \"ensuring the stability and security of France, the struggle for the rights of workers and families, the protection and realization of the sovereignty of France\" and the coalition did not deviate from these goals by a single step: social benefits were expanded, material support for families was introduced, the labor code and labor rights were improved, they even introduced subsidies to farmers and launched a serious anti-drug campaign, as well as increased the size of the police, tightened laws and increased the provision and salaries of the armed forces and law enforcement. Together, a provision was made in the French Constitution to renounce membership in foreign military organizations, which marked the end of France's membership in Western military structures.{0}However, contradictions in the further reform course caused discord in the coalition of the National Front and the Communist Party: until the elections it exists only formally so as not to dismiss the government. But for the upcoming elections, former partners will go on opposite sides of the electoral barricades.\r\nGaucho-lepenisme{0}Failures in foreign policy and the failure to secure the promised full sovereignty lowered Chirac's popularity as a \"strong personality\" and coincided with the unsuccessful reforms of Prime Minister Villepin, who tried to significantly expand the rights of employers, which led to mass strikes and rallies of trade unions and leftists.{0}Disappointed in his politics even the Chirac party, nominating the extremely moderate and pro-American candidate Nicolas Sarkozy for the next elections, due to which most of the electorate, who wanted sovereignty and greatness, went to Jean-Marie Le Pen and his National Front party. However, within Le Pen's party, the idea that \"the national problems of France pass through the prism of social ones\" began to gain more and more popularity, which was called \"gaucho-lepenisme\" (\"left lepenism\"), which takes its origins from pujadism, anti-intellectualism, anti-corporatism and social state capitalism.{0}Jean-Marie Le Pen's aspirations to win both the right and the left electorate were successful: Lionel Jospin (with a program to make the right to housing an inalienable basic right of a citizen) and Jean-Marie Le Pen himself made it to the second round of elections. Unexpectedly, with a small margin of votes thanks to populist rhetoric, Jean-Marie Le Pen was elected President of France in the second round, but the parliamentary elections did not give enough results to the National Front for a majority. The majority of political parties took part in the negotiations. {0}In the course of lengthy discussions, the National Front announced the creation of a coalition government with the Union in Support of the Republic. The new political force launched a campaign to protect cultural and national values, fight against immigrants, strengthen security and expand the rights of the police. Criticism of the United States of America and its allies intensified in foreign policy, however, at the same time, France continued to express a desire to cooperate with other Western European countries within the framework of a \"common European security system.\" moderation in social, budgetary and labor projects, paying special attention to helping farmers and the program of \"encouraging deurbanization\" - moving from cities to villages on a preferential basis - which turned out to be of little success. The left-wing electorate, which was expecting serious reforms, and the far-right electorate, hoping for more radical politics, turned away from such a government, and therefore the popularity of the National Front fell sharply, and a coalition of left and center-left parties is expected to win in the next elections.\r\nItaly\r\nBerlinguer heritage{0}The success of the Eurocommunist strategy led Italy to deepen social and democratic reforms. The departure from the principle of class struggle and most of the dogmatic attitudes developed in the 1930s in the Stalinist USSR made it possible to update the ideological base of the Communist Party, and expand the electoral base due to openness to the middle class. The appeal to European general humanist values seriously influenced the pro-Soviet communist parties in other European countries, incl. in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Norway. This led to a sharp rise in the votes cast for the Communists in these countries, although even earlier, even many Soviet scholars recognized the decline of the labor movement in some of these countries. Accusations of revisionism by Maoist, Hoxhaist and Trotskyist organizations only added to the popularity of the democratic alternative to Soviet communism and Western capitalism. {0}In Italy itself, the heirs of Berlinguer's policy continued the implementation of Eurocommunist policy - the democratization of the economy and politics, the expansion of the influence of trade union organizations and a number of other progressive reforms.{0}{1}\r\nHistoric compromise{0}The policy of historical compromise was able to qualitatively change Italian democracy. The electoral successes of the communists became impossible to ignore, and such a high level of electoral influence was converted into political influence due to the entry of representatives of the ICP into a coalition government with the CDA. The emergence of a force defending the interests of the working class and the intelligentsia not only in the arena of parliamentary battles and trade union struggle, but also in the structures of the central government, led not only to the strengthening of the role and status of the communists in Italian politics, but also to the sharing of responsibility in implementing reforms with the Christian Democrats. {0}With the reforms themselves, everything turned out to be ambiguous, since the communists received only minor portfolios in the government, the most significant posts remained with the Christian Democrats. Only a number of reforms were promoted, affecting the tax system (primarily taxes on wealth and capital gains), the role of trade unions in enterprises and the mechanism of regional self-government. Nevertheless, despite the scarcity of reforms and their, in many respects, social democratic sense, the expansion of social guarantees, the expansion of free education and medicine led to an increase in the popularity of the ICP, but caused unspoken sabotage by entrepreneurs who began to strengthen material support for the CDA and the socialists.{0}Nevertheless, in the next elections, the PCI was able to increase its result, receiving 36% against 40% for the Christian Democrats. However, it was not possible to form such a broad coalition again. The CDA leader recognized the policy of historical compromise as “unpromising” and “threatening the national sovereignty in Italy”, since with its help “Moscow could receive information related to the military and economic potential of Italy and NATO countries”. As a result, the Christian Democrats decided to form a coalition with the Socialists, the post of Prime Minister was taken by the leader of the ISP, Bettino Craxi. Thus, the policy of historical compromise ended before it even began.{0}\r\nMoro's Retribution{0}After the victory of the Moreau party in the elections, the new government headed for the centre-left reforms. Moro dealt with his political opponents uncompromisingly and harshly, no longer agreeing to concessions and compromises (with the exception of a coalition with the socialists).{0}Amid the growing popularity of the Democratic Alternative, two other traditional Italian parties, the Christian Democrats and the Communists, fell into decline. The former failed to adapt to the new conditions and disappeared from the political map in the late 1990s. The free niche of the center-right party in the 1990s will be occupied by Forward, Italy! led by businessman Silvio Berlusconi. The Communist Party will experience a split. The right wing, which was guided by the social democratic principles, will defect to the Socialist Party, and the left will have to return again under the influence of the Soviet communists and retreat from the principles of Eurocommunism. \r\nNational Maoist utopia{0}Led by a special Committee for the National Liberation of Italy, represented by Enzo Maria Dantini, Hugo Serafino Di Luia and Hugo Cascella, the new Italy entered the ranks of \"revolutionary nationalism\" under the banner of Nazi-Maoism. The main ideologists and philosophers of the movement were declared to be the fighter against imperialism Mao Zedong, the representative of the uprising of the spirit against old values, Friedrich Nietzsche, Che Guevara, who went beyond the right and left, the national esoteric Julius Evola and the existentialist Sartre. And the whole ideology began to rest on three pillars: anti-imperialism, anti-Zionism and anti-capitalism. {0}The theorists of the \"national revolution\" proclaimed a new slogan \"each state has its own nation\", thereby declaring a new principle of ethno-nationalism, where each nation has the right to its own state and must live exclusively in their own state. At the same time, despite the rejection of the Soviet Union, it is argued that socialism was strengthened in the Soviet Union only thanks to the policy of Stalinist Russocentrism and the rejection of the internationalist project. {0}Physically liquidating the leaders of the right and left movements who disagree with the new regime Associazione Lotta di Popolo - the new ruling party, which declared itself as \"not left and not right\" - absorbed many ordinary extreme right and extreme left elements. And then she adopted a new external political doctrine - after leaving the NPT, the new Italian authorities declared that “anti-fascism and anti-communism are false oppositions created by the system to distract revolutionary forces and the unity of the Italian people should be revived outside and against institutions in order to free themselves from political, economic and cultural exploitation of the imperialism of Russia, the United States, the Vatican and world Zionism. {0}In line with their statements, Italian domestic political reforms touched on many aspects: the Blackshirts were revived, a one-party system was established, the big bourgeoisie was shot, a system of decentralized self-governing syndicates was introduced without private property under strong state regulation and state control over the banking and monetary systems. The eradication of other cultures, except for a single Italian, began, segregation racial legislation was revived, and army ranks were abandoned when adopting the Maoist theory of a popular mass guerrilla army and building up all of Italy with bunkers assigned to each family.\r\nComrade Kosutta{0}Italy under the rule of Kossuta underwent significant changes, and the first of them affected the Communist Party itself: from the very beginning, Kossuta's supporters were pro-Soviet activists standing on the positions of the Italian Operaismo movement, and, taking as a basis Lenin's late thesis that \"the path to socialism lies through cooperativization economy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the workers' state\", Kossuta with his supporters deepened Operaismo and established it as the leading ideology in the party, while the liberal wing was subject to lustration. It is also worth noting that from the very beginning of their rule, after asserting control over the party, the new authorities carried out a number of political reforms aimed at strengthening the power of the workers and the communist party: all elections for deputy seats began to be carried out through single-member districts, nominations on party lists were canceled, and only persons not engaged in business began to be admitted to the election as candidates. At the same time, elections have become multi-staged according to the patterns of direct democracy, when first the Council in the region is elected, then the Councils of Regions - in the district, and the Councils of Districts - the Supreme Council. Such a reform allowed Kossuta to use all available state and party levers to consolidate the dominance of the communist party.{0}At the same time, the new Italy took a social example from East Germany in relation to gender rights, equality regardless of orientation, the tolerance of nudism and other forms of social freedom whith refusing to impose one's social behavior on other people. At the same time, the state increased pressure in economic policy: all strategically important sectors of the economy were nationalized, an external monopoly on trade was established, a planning committee was formed (whose composition is elected once every 5 years by the Supreme Council, and not approved by the party), corporations were liquidated, strict rules for the fight against monopolies, as well as benefits, subsidies and other assistance to young cooperatives. Propaganda began to glorify the \"communal way of life\", while Italy itself was divided into partially self-governing communes, spacious wide communal houses came into fashion, weekly communal \"gatherings\" and even the management of state enterprises was transferred to labor collectives. But despite this, enterprises are still committed to strictly fulfilling the five-year plan and the tasks given to them by the planning committee, thereby maintaining a centralized economic approach to decentralized local self-government.{0}At the same time, in foreign policy, Italy remains a true friend of Moscow, having established strong and close ties with the countries of the Eastern Bloc and the old socialist world.\r\nComrade Ingrao{0}Ingrao's reign is primarily remembered for the final liquidation of fascist movements in Italy and the reorganization of the Communist Party: all fascist movements and movements praising fascism, Mussolini, Francoism or other forms of fascism were banned, as well as their symbols, and the leaders were arrested. At the same time, an official \"lustration\" was announced in the country, according to which anyone who at least somehow collaborated with the authorities under Mussolini was deprived of all political rights and the opportunity to work in the public service (thus overturning many leading political forces). As for the Communist Party, Ingrao turned sharply to the leftist youth movements in Italy, using young activists to reshuffle and rejuvenate the ranks of the party. And the second cabinet minister under Ingrao began to consist of the youngest ministers in the history of Italy. The renewal of the ranks of the party led to the renewal of the party ideology: in contrast to the liberal and pro-Soviet wing, the ideology of the new left and libertarian socialism was established. Domestic policy also underwent significant changes: feminism, extreme environmentalism, and trade unionism were adopted.{0}Such changes led to the introduction of huge \"ecological\" laws, the abandonment of nuclear power plants, the introduction of a social rating of citizens (with rewards and punishments), mandatory unionization of enterprises (the transfer of all enterprises to the ownership of the labor collective in a joint-stock form), along with harsh antitrust and anti-corporate taxes and a tax on wealth. flight of minds\" and by 2001, unable to cope with the economic problems that had arisen, the Communist Party of Italy split into three parties: \"Left Democrats\" (democratic socialists and social democrats), \"Communist Renaissance Party\" (radical anarchists and libertarian socialists) and \" Party of Italian Communists\" (pragmatists and supporters of the Operaismo idea, led by Cossuto). Despite this, Ingrao once again won the election, nominated as \"non-partisan from all progressive left forces.\" The split of the Communist Party led to an increase in the popularity of the centrist forces, but not a single force eventually managed to win a parliamentary majority, which led to the formation of a parliamentary coalition.{0} Three parts of the former unified Communist Party, despite their differences, were able to agree and form a ruling coalition. To combat capital flight, a decision was made to \"temporarily nationalize all enterprises that threaten the national security of the country\" - which legally meant the transfer of all dissenting corporations under state control while maintaining the transfer of profits to their owners. And to combat the brain drain, the government has greatly expanded the rights of the student council, effectively placing the running of the educational institutions and teaching program in the hands of the students, hoping that the \"atmosphere of freedom\" will engender new \"homeland-loyal\" minds. However, all polls show that this will be the last term for Ingrao, and he himself understands this, which means that in the future the three fragments of the Communist Party will again fight for leadership.\r\nComrade Napolitano{0}Napolitano's reign began with his famous phrase: \"The Communist Party cannot rule alone, otherwise it will be a dictatorship.\" Giorgio Napolitano called for the formation of a \"government of national unity\" and, through mediation, a coalition was formed between the Communist Party, the Italian Socialists and the Italian People's Party. The coalition received approval from the Vatican and set as its goal the \"democratic reform of capitalism.\" The government began moderate social reforms, which led to a general increase in the welfare of the population, but the discontent of the right-wing forces, who accused the regime of \"Bolshevizing the economy\" and \"encouraging laziness\" despite the fact that the reforms did not include either socialization or nationalization of anything, but only the strengthening of labor rights, trade union rights, budgetary social spending and state regulation. In protest against the \"excessively soft\" policy of the Communist Party, after the failed attempts to remove Napolitano, a group of pro-Soviet communists led by Cossuto left it, which created the Communist Renaissance Party. The departure of the most left wing from the party led to the strengthening of the positions of the liberal wing and the ruling party abandoned all its past attitudes and even rejected Lenin, taking the positions of Austro-Marxism and Luxembourgism. the wing of the new left at the party congress demanded the socialization of enterprises and their transfer into the hands of labor collectives. But their demands were not met, and they also left the ranks of the party. Another split coincided with the budget deficit and, as a result, the forced increase in taxes to maintain the social state. All this has led to the popularization of forces on the right side of the political compass. Not wanting to run for another presidential term (so as not to break the political tradition), Napolitano was forced to run for president again. His last term was crowned with a massive reorganization of the Communist Party, the Italian Socialists and the Italian People's Party into a single party, the Democrats of the Left \"in order to counter the growing threat from the right-wing forces.\" {0} democratic type. Under the rule of Napolitano, Italy became a state of generally recognized neutrality, retaining all the political features and system of a democratic post-war Italy, and Sergio Mattarella, a former Christian Democrat and member of the ruling Left Democrats, was elected his successor to the post of President, who promised to continue the policy of his predecessor \"defending democracy and capitalism with a human face\".\r\nEra Almirante{0}Having come to power as part of a motley coalition from fascists to conservative liberals, Almirante continued his intra-party policy of \"seemingly a radical, in fact a pragmatist\", transferring it to the entire government. Constantly making radical statements and rude speeches, Almirante implemented a de facto national-conservative policy: paternalistic economic methods were analogous to French dirigisme, the state supported traditional and family cultural values, Mussolini was not rehabilitated, but was recognized as an ambiguous historical figure, and to calm the masses were introduced some social guarantees and benefits.{0}At the same time, Almirante launched a truly broad campaign to combat radicalism: terrorists were entitled to the death penalty, and even those who simply rented an apartment to terrorists were recorded as accomplices: many anti-terrorist laws were taken from the FRG. And with the next blow, the Italian secret services, after a long investigation, revealed the facts of financing of many politicians of the PCI by the KGB, which led to a sharp drop in the authority and rating of the PCI and its transformation into the Democratic Party of the Left. {0}After Almirante's death, the national coalition and the MSI party were headed by Duce's granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini, who continued the previous policy of pragmatic cooperation, but brought new trends to Italian fascism in order to stay afloat of social changes: fascist feminism, postmodern art, pro-Zionism and an active fight against gypsies and Romanians (gypsies were declared \"criminal societies\" and became taken to internment camps, and the Romanians were declared \"historical criminals claiming the great Roman heritage\").\r\nRomualdi era{0}Having come to power against the backdrop of mass popular protests against the old regime, Romualdi confidently agreed to infuse right-wing conservative forces into the party. Interaction with the youth and the South (the main base of the neo-fascists) was transferred to Romualdi's comrade-in-arms - Pino Rauti, who quickly began to put together neo-fascist legions to counter the leftist forces. The government began to support neo-fascist trade unions to counter the Reds, and also implemented a policy of rehabilitation of the Republic of Salo: its Constitution and laws were recognized as exemplary for the formation of a native Italian people's state.{0}As part of the implementation of the new policy, the IRI was restored, endowed with the right not only to provide financial assistance to businesses and banks, but also to trade unions and peasant communities, as well as the right to freeze prices in the event of a \"threat to national security\" and the right to nationalize \"unpatriotic businesses.\" The new authorities also made it mandatory for businesses and corporations to conclude contracts exclusively through unions and to hire only those who are members of unions.{0}In general, Romualdi's rule was not only accompanied by a balancing act between expanding the rights of workers and providing financial assistance to corporations to appease them, but also the rehabilitation of the late Mussolini, the historical reappraisal of the past and the support of cultural conservatism, traditionalism and fascist modernism. At the same time, the citizenship law was reformed based on the principles of \"blood and allegiance.\" However, to alleviate mass dissatisfaction, exclusively democratic and legal terminology was used: an applicant seeking citizenship had to undergo an interview to confirm their proficiency in Italian as their native language and demonstrate their overall engagement with Italian culture, including knowledge of Italian history, literature and art, and additionally, as a mandatory requirement, they had to provide legally certified evidence of having at least one Italian ancestor within the first to third generations among their closest relatives. Political opposition to the regime was attempted by the Eurocommunist ICP, which rallied all the left around itself, which has every chance of winning the 1989 elections, since after the death of Romualdi in 1988, an active struggle began in the MSI leadership between the right-wing conservatives Fini and the radical fascists Rauti.\r\nFeeney era{0}In order to achieve the complete political isolation of the left and the stabilization of Italy, Almirante decided to nominate his young protégé Gianfranco Fini from the broad center-right coalition led by MSI, thanks to which even fragments of the former ISP supported the new government. Bypassing any issues related to Mussolini and the past, Fini began to implement a liberal economic policy: the state abandoned economic intervention, taxes were reduced, state property was privatized, and a tax amnesty was introduced. At the same time, the government provided strong protectionism and raised import duties, but also heeded the recommendations of trade unions on the implementation of welfare programs.{0}The state supported a program to preserve and protect cultural and traditional values in the country. The radicals who protested against such a \"moderate\" position of MSI left the party, and after the death of Almirante, MSI was headed by Gianfranco Fini and transformed from a fascist party into a right-wing conservative National Alliance party, abandoning fascist attitudes, and the young politician Silvio Berlusconi.\r\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the political map of Italy underwent major changes. After the death of Enrico Berlinguer and the departure of Alessandro Natta as general secretary, the PCI was headed by Achille Occheto, who began to dismantle the Eurocommunist and Marxist attitudes in the party and announced the transition to a social democratic platform. At a congress in 1990, the Communist Party dissolved itself and was replaced by the Democratic Left Party. Part of the orthodox Marxists and Eurocommunists, like Kossuta and Ingrao, refused to join the new party and created their own - the Communist Renaissance Party.{0}The positions of the left in the country weakened - the PDL gained only 16% in the 1992 elections, although the CDA also had a leadership undermined, they scored only 29%. In the second half of the 1990s, the PDLS would join the Oliva block of left-wing parties, but by the end of the decade it would fall apart, and the party’s successors would even move away from social democratic positions.{0}In 1992-1993, law enforcement agencies set about eradicating the influence of the mafia and criminal groups for election campaigns and political life. But the results of the trials were unprecedented. The threads of the investigation led to the very top - the tops of the largest political parties - Christian Democrats and Socialists - were somehow connected with the mafia.{0}After such a blow, the traditional parties of Italy disappeared from the political arena. Silvio Berlusconi's party «Forward, Italy» occupied a free niche. \r\nComrade Ingrao{0}Ingrao's reign is primarily remembered for the final liquidation of fascist movements in Italy and the reorganization of the Communist Party: all fascist movements and movements praising fascism, Mussolini, Francoism or other forms of fascism were banned, as well as their symbols, and the leaders were arrested. At the same time, an official \"lustration\" was announced in the country, according to which anyone who at least somehow collaborated with the authorities under Mussolini was deprived of all political rights and the opportunity to work in the public service (thus overturning many leading political forces). As for the Communist Party, Ingrao turned sharply to the leftist youth movements in Italy, using young activists to reshuffle and rejuvenate the ranks of the party. And the second cabinet minister under Ingrao began to consist of the youngest ministers in the history of Italy. The renewal of the ranks of the party led to the renewal of the party ideology: in contrast to the liberal and pro-Soviet wing, the ideology of the new left and libertarian socialism was established. Domestic policy also underwent significant changes: feminism, extreme environmentalism, and trade unionism were adopted.{0}Such changes led to the introduction of huge \"ecological\" laws, the abandonment of nuclear power plants, the introduction of a social rating of citizens (with rewards and punishments), mandatory unionization of enterprises (the transfer of all enterprises to the ownership of the labor collective in a joint-stock form), along with harsh antitrust and anti-corporate taxes and a tax on wealth. flight of minds\" and by 2001, unable to cope with the economic problems that had arisen, the Communist Party of Italy split into three parties: \"Left Democrats\" (democratic socialists and social democrats), \"Communist Renaissance Party\" (radical anarchists and libertarian socialists) and \" Party of Italian Communists\" (pragmatists and supporters of the Operaismo idea, led by Cossuto). Despite this, Ingrao once again won the election, nominated as \"non-partisan from all progressive left forces.\" The split of the Communist Party led to an increase in the popularity of the centrist forces, but not a single force eventually managed to win a parliamentary majority, which led to the formation of a parliamentary coalition.{0} Against the backdrop of the defeat of the socialist camp, the Left Democrats decided to form a coalition with the centrist bloc Daisy and the League of the North ( movement for the autonomy of the Padania region). The new government canceled the \"radical reforms\" of the previous governments by turning to the ideas of the social liberal economy in the new government, thereby stopping the flight of capital and brains. The recession was corrected through deregulation and large government injections into sectors of the economy. In protest against the \"destruction of all his works\", Ingrao announced his entry into the \"Party of Italian Communists\" and tried to organize a coalition between them and the Cossuto party, but in the conditions of a parliamentary republic there was little he could oppose to the ruling bloc.{0}The Italian economy again stood on legs, but one can no longer dream of any socialism. However, all polls show that this will be the last term for Ingrao, and he himself understands this, which means that the centrists have every chance to finally gain a foothold in the ruling system of Italy.\r\nWith the reformers coming to power in the USSR, relations between the ICP and the CPSU were restored, and relations between Moscow and Rome became significantly warmer. \r\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, serious changes will await Italian policy - against the backdrop of reforms in the USSR, the Communist Party will split into supporters of the social democratic platform and adherents of Marxism and Eurocommunism. Other traditional Italian parties will disappear, such as the Socialists and Christian Democrats, after a corruption scandal. \r\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Italian politics will face major changes - the traditional Italian parties will disappear, such as the Socialists and Christian Democrats, will disappear after a corruption scandal. The Communist Party will continue to exist, but will never be able to repeat the results of the mid-1970s.\r\nAfter the disappearance of traditional Italian parties, throughout the 1980s, political instability and conflicts between left and right parties continued, fueled by the growth of terrorism and extremism. However, in the 1990s, the political situation began to stabilize, and the empty niches of the left and right centers were filled by new parties that were no longer associated with either the CDA or the ISP. \r\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the political map of Italy underwent major changes. After the death of Enrico Berlinguer and the resignation of General Secretary Alessandro Natta, the PCI was headed by Achilla Occheto, who tried to dismantle the Eurocommunist and Marxist attitudes in the party and announced the transition to a social democratic platform. However, the 1990 convention rejected Okketo's initiative and the moderate Ingrao took over the party. The ICP continued to exist, but the party situation, which was formed after the end of the Second World War, changed significantly.{0}In 1992-1993, law enforcement agencies set about eradicating the influence of the mafia and criminal groups on election campaigns and political life. But the results of the trials were unprecedented. The threads of the investigation led to the very top - the tops of the largest political parties - Christian Democrats and Socialists - were somehow connected with the mafia.{0}After such a blow, the traditional parties of Italy disappeared from the political arena.

Nevertheless, there were no obvious departures from the principles of Kemalism, and Turkey continued the policy laid down by Ataturk. \r\nAfter military defeats and the collapse of the Turkish military, Turkey's neighbors decided to take advantage of the country's weakness and acquire new territories at its expense. The Soviet Union, which put forward claims to the straits and territories of the former imperial lands, obviously became a monopoly on the Black Sea and significantly strengthened its position in the region.

Leap into capitalism.{0}The new Soviet leader, guided by near-Menshevik ideas about the need to overcome capitalism in order to build genuine socialism, began the implementation of a reform program.{0}As part of the plan to \"beat Lenin on Stalin\", the democratization of the Soviet system was carried out: the role of Soviet institutions was restored by analogy with the Constitution of 1924. Ideologically, the new leadership began a new round of de-Stalinization and rehabilitation of the political victims of the Stalinist era. Effective democratization made it possible to stop the claims of the second secretaries to power, but at the same time to renew the party apparatus of the times of stagnation and overcome the \"gerontocracy.\" {0} administrative function, the rejection of ideological work and the general line. The CPSU was reformed into the SPSU, the Socialist Party of the Soviet Union, and intra-party factions were legalized. As part of it, the following activities were carried out: the legalization of business, the return of the institution of private property, the privatization of small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the emerging new Soviet democracy was immediately put under pressure by the “red directors”, who finally gained full control over their enterprises.{0}In foreign policy, the Soviet Union continued to improve relations with the United States and the West and actively confront To China.{0}There has been a \"convergence\" of capitalism and socialism...\r\nGreat Britain\r\nRomanov's adventure led to the formation in the countries of the socialist camp of regimes even more loyal to Moscow with a tough authoritarian government that suppresses any dissent and opposition. \r\nIn addition, the vast Soviet Union, which previously occupied one-sixth of the land, expanded after the entry of Poland, Mongolia and Bulgaria.\r\nAfter the entry of the Soviet Union into NATO, all of its satellites successfully changed course 180 degrees, and followed the \"Big Brother\".

The unification of states on a socialist basis instead of a neoliberal one demonstrates the advantages of socialism! Over time, the integration of countries only intensified and a unified army command, a single customs and economic space, and open borders were created.\r\n{0}The defeat of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War was a strong blow to the country and provoked a severe political crisis, but the new leadership, with the support of the JNA generals, was able to retain power by force and suppress the speeches of Slovenian and Croatian separatists. Throughout the 80s and 90s, large-scale reforms were carried out in the SFRY: there was a departure from Titoism and partial liberalization in politics (a limited multi-party system was allowed while maintaining the leading role of the SKJ, transformed into a Eurocommunist party, some of the Chetniks and even some Ustashe and Bosniak nationalists were rehabilitated, the system of councils and assemblies was simplified), the economy underwent a transition to a regulated market economy with the privatization of enterprises by their employees. This initially caused significant social problems, but then allowed to pay off the external debt and resume economic growth. At the same time, the influence of the Muslim Bosniaks noticeably increased in the renewed federation: under the Pozderats-Abdić duumvirate, they occupied over 60% of the leading positions, which causes deaf discontent of other peoples. In foreign policy, the SFRY is deepening cooperation with the EEC (which it was finally admitted to in 1995) and the Arab world, while refusing to recognize territorial changes and periodically threatening Albania with either sanctions or the threat of war.\r\n{0}The victory of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo war caused a significant moral upsurge and strengthened the position of supporters of the country's centralization. At the XIII Congress of the SKJ in 1986, they were able to get a majority of votes and make a decision on the need to revise the Constitution of 1974 in the direction of reducing the powers of the republics in favor of the federation and strengthening the planned principles in the economy. This aroused the resistance of Slovenia and Croatia, which, however, was not supported even by some of the local leaders. The post of the President (elected by the now unicameral Assembly) and the principle of democratic centralism in the SKJ, which became a single party, were restored. Gosplan and Gossnab were also recreated, price controls were established, and the election of directors of enterprises was abolished. Gradually, the role of Tito in the history of the country was partially revised - his opponents of 1948 were rehabilitated, while the cult of Tito as a partisan leader and hero of the national liberation struggle was preserved. All this led to some estrangement of Yugoslavia from the Western world and its rapprochement with the social bloc - however, the SFRY still does not intend to join its structures. As for Albania, it lost all independence and in 1997 was directly annexed to Yugoslavia.\r\n{0}To the surprise of the world community, the forcibly created union of Albania, Yugoslavia and Romania turned out to be stronger than expected - through the mediation of the PRC, the parties more or less agreed on the status of the disputed territories (Albania renounced claims to the SFRY in exchange for granting Kosovo the status of a republic and economic preferences, was the Romanian-Yugoslav status of using the Danube was determined), joint cultural events were periodically held (the Balkan song festival in Split in 1991 was first visited by all three leaders - Juli Bufi, Branko Kostic and Manya Menescu), economic cooperation expanded, and closer to the mid-90s years, the countries managed to agree on a single political line - for example, in 2001 they jointly condemned the American blockade of Cuba and, on behalf of the Balkan community, demanded that it be lifted. Analysts suggest that in the foreseeable future, the regional union will begin to transform into a confederate state - however, it is too early to talk about this.\r\n{0}As expected, the union of Tirana, Belgrade and Bucharest rested only on Chinese pressure (which turned out to be insufficient in the end) and turned out to be short-lived - the parties constantly disrupted negotiations, could not agree on joint cultural events (the Balkan song festival in Brasov in 1991 visited only by the Yugoslavs and ended in a mass brawl between Croats and Gypsies), economic cooperation developed slowly and with many obstacles. The superpowers, seeing the weakness of Chinese influence in the region, also did not leave it unattended, as a result of which, in 1992, Romania raised the issue of dissolving the Balkan community as \"not meeting the interests of any of the countries.\" For the only time in its short history, the three leaders shook hands sincerely, and then Albania immediately \"remembered\" the \"oppression of the Albanians in Yugoslavia by the Titoist national fascists - the Macedonian Serbs\".\r\nUnited GDR{0}The unification of East and West had taken place. However, the contradictions between the socialist system and the capitalist system were too great to simply integrate the FRG into the GDR, so the GDR leadership decided to take the desperate step of reintroducing the 1949 constitution. First of all, the federal division of the state into \"LГ¤nder\" and \"Land Chamber\", abolished in the 1950s, was restored, thus restoring the bicameral parliament. The office of the President was also restored, elected by popular vote, although his powers were only nominal, even less than those of the President of the former Federal Republic of Germany. However, there was no reversion to bourgeois symbols: all symbols of the GDR were retained, and the first article of the Constitution that \"the German Democratic Republic is a socialist state of the German nation\" was taken from the 1968 version, not 1949. At the same time were nationalised and transferred to the status of \"people's\" large and medium-sized enterprises, legalised private business, the introduction of price regulation and the East German mark in the West.{0}It was more difficult to establish the work of parties and political bodies. Taking into account that all parties in the GDR were members of the Popular Front, it was decided to unite East German and West German parties into a single nationwide: CDU with CDU, FDP with LDPG, and CSU with NDPG. However, there was no place in such a system for the SPD, which in the East had long ago merged into the SED. And the SPD politicians flatly refused to join the ruling party, so they \"had to act by force\" - the most intransigent were put under house arrest and the party was dissolved. Former German leaders Willy Brandt and Wilhelm Schmidt, as well as other figures of the Socialist International, condemned this course of events. Also causing trouble was the West German Communist Party, which was banned in the 1950s but announced at a recent congress that it would be reinstated. The emergence of a second communist party in a country with an underdeveloped public democracy immediately confounded the SED leadership, which did not want to share its \"monopoly on Marxist-Leninist doctrine\" and therefore forced some party members to join the SED, and repressed the less loyal (Trotskyists, Stalinists and Hoxhaists). {0)Germany became united, even the Berlin Wall was dismantled, and the capital was declared united Berlin.{0}On the other hand, in the course of the unification of the two Germanies appeared several opposition parties that are not part of a united ruling front, which now can not just be crushed or banned. Among them 3 parties became the striking representatives: Democratic Awakening (declaring Christian socialism, headed by Angela Merkel), Association of Free Democrats (declaring Christian conservatism and economic pragmatism, headed by Rainer Ortleb) and Citizens' Alliance-Greens (declaring democratic socialism, headed by Gregor Gisi). And they may well soon win enough seats in at least the House of LГ¤nder in the general election to become a huge pain in the SED's arse.\r\nEternal revolution{0}The Trotskyist-Labor plan of government was pragmatic and flexible, but at the same time it remained committed to its principles: having strengthened, the government announced the implementation of the “socialist alternative” program - a project of radical but cautious reforms based on the theory of Marx-Lenin-Trotsky and taking into account mistakes building socialism in other countries. First of all, laws were passed that reduce the powers of the House of Lords only to legislative initiative and the right of veto, which can be overcome by 50% + 1 votes of the lower house. Then a radical reform of the lower chamber was carried out - it turned into the Chamber of Soviets: the whole country was divided into regions, electing local self-government Councils, which elect Councils from their membership at the national level, and they already elect the Chamber of Soviets itself. Such a reform met with resistance among the conservative part of society, but the protesters and dissatisfied were quickly \"brought to their senses\" and calmed down with the support of armed miners. And in general, it was the reliance on the miners that solved many problems for the ruling power, allowing it to have a controlled, but de jure independent tool to fight the opposition. At the same time, the economic reforms were distinguished by the development of a new unique approach: denying both the wholesale nationalization of bureaucratic Stalinism and the approach of the trade unionists and syndicalists divorced from reality, the Trotskyists presented a draft of the so-called. \"socialization of the economy\". It consisted in an attempt to \"Marxist overcome capitalism in a natural way, increasing its qualitative changes from within\": the introduction of a progressive tax and a tax on wealth was accompanied by the deprivation of businessmen of political rights, the mandatory inclusion of trade union representatives in the governing bodies of corporations and the creation of a system \"an employee is a co-owner\", when businessmen were obliged to allocate to each hired worker a share of shares without the right to withdraw upon dismissal, thereby increasing the involvement of workers in the economy and reducing the number of layoffs.{0}To prevent capital flight, the state introduced a monopoly on foreign trade and nationalized the banking system. In his speech on the subject, Ted Grant stated: \"This is exactly the NEP that Lenin wanted to see, and exactly the policy that corresponds to the current state of society.\" At the same time, in foreign policy, Britain completely abandoned all \"bourgeois\" military, political and economic alliances and structures and organized the center of the successor to the Comintern in London in the person of the Fourth International. But the reaction against such actions is gradually raising its head and time will tell whether the Trotskyist Workers' Party can successfully hold on to power in Britain or fall under the onslaught of the counter-revolution.\r\nEternal revolution{0}From the very beginning, Labor Trotskyist rule was characterized by intra-party opposition between radicals and moderates, because of which the government was often forced to compromise and accept compromise reform programs, and the only decision taken unanimously was the complete withdrawal from all military and political alliances and the introduction of moratorium on nuclear testing. In economic policy, the government has promoted the \"Frankenstein reform\": labor rights and social guarantees have been significantly expanded, budget spending and the number of social programs have been increased, and the criteria for access to them by the population have been liberalized. The first thing this led to, in addition to increasing wealth, was an attempt to flight capital, which the authorities decided to stop by imposing additional taxes on transactions and investments outside Britain. Further, employers tried to start hiring workers illegally under the guise of contracts with individual entrepreneurs in order to evade taxes, and the authorities began to fight this by passing a law on mandatory membership in trade unions. All this, in fact, led to the withdrawal of business into the shadow sector and a reduction in tax revenues. Political reforms, however, were much more radical: the powers of the House of Lords were reduced to advisory powers, the Queen lost the right to reject the candidacy of the Prime Minister, the turnout was made mandatory for every citizen, external party funding was prohibited, and laws passed to combat racism and chauvinism hit the right and conservative parties significantly. However, the established dominance in the electoral system did not lead to the stabilization of the party's position and the final blow for it was the economic default caused by excessive budget deficits and the impossibility of overcoming it due to the lack of intra-party consent.{0}Following the default, the government resigned and the Labor split: moderates accused the government of populism and ignorance of the economy, broke away and created the Social Democratic Party along with the left wing of the Liberal Party. Then the new leftists tried to remove the old Trotskyists led by Ted Grant at the congress, and when they did not succeed, they also left the ranks of the Laborites, accusing Grant of traditionalism, authoritarianism and bureaucracy, and created the New Labor Party, declaring neo-Marxism and anti-monarchism. The remaining Trotskyists and Radical Labor rallied around Ted Grant himself and adopted a new “loyalty to the workers” program that denounces postmodernism, the New Left movement and reliance on student activism, and emphasizes links with workers, unions, and strict centralized education. and state support for proletarian art.{0}Thus, the Laborites and the two parties that separated from them, as well as the Liberal Party, became the favorites for the upcoming early elections.{0}{1} \r\nLiberal victory{0}The victory in the 1983 elections of the Liberal Party was short-lived. The government failed to offer a real positive program that would be qualitatively different from both the Labor agenda and the conservative one. Moreover, relying solely on the middle class and business circles prevented the electoral expansion for the Liberal Party.{0}In the next elections, the Conservatives returned to power. \r\nDemocratic socialism{0}Michael Foot's government continued the Keynesian policies that characterized Britain in the last 30 years of the post-war years. The new government included the most left-wing members of the Labor Party, including Tony Benn, known for his Marxist views, took over as Minister of Economics. He initiated syndicalist reforms in industry, which consisted in the nationalization of enterprises, the creation of the foundations for economic directive planning, and the expansion of the independence of enterprises and work collectives. Capital controls were put in place to prevent businesses from leaving. He repeated his thesis of the early 1980s: within the first weeks \"we must return all powers from Brussels to Westminster, and then abolish the House of Lords.\" Indeed, the upper house of parliament was abolished after the referendum. The case law and traditions on which the British monarchy is based have been called into question. An attempt on the empiricism and adherence to traditions characteristic of the British mentality leads to a logical conclusion - is a monarchy needed at all. Benn, a glib orator in the British Parliament, declared that \"for every queen there is a guillotine\" and if any monarch tries to interfere with the cause of socialism, then \"the fate of Marie Antoinette will await him.\" proclaimed a federal state, which in fact meant a significant expansion of the already not small powers of autonomy of the provinces.{0}Thus, Great Britain has become a fully democratic state, embodying all the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. \r\nBreakdown of the System{0}The coalition of Liberals, Social Democrats and Labor fundamentally hit the traditional party system of Great Britain, where since the early 1920s two parties dominated - the Conservative and Labor, and the Liberals had much less influence.{0}Now, The ideological defeat of the Conservatives led to numerous splits in the party and led to the fact that the party of the once greatest prime ministers fell to the level of the Communist Party of Great Britain and did not get into Parliament., who in the next election left the coalition with Labor and began to pursue their own independent policy. The country now has a three-party political system. \r\nStronghold of neoliberalism{0}Until the end of the 1980s. Britain was led by Margaret Thatcher, who continued her neoliberal course of dismantling the welfare state. The reforms were able to restore economic growth, but it cost Britain a complete suppression of the labor union movement.{0}After the departure of the Iron Lady from the post of prime minister, the conservative John Major became the new leader. However, despite economic growth, social inequality has also increased greatly. As a result, the 1997 elections were won by Labor, led by Tony Blair and his new \"new labor\" program.\r\nUnited FRG{0}The unification of the West and the East took place. Immediately after such a rude annexation, the question arose - what to do with the party and the \"servants\" of the previous regime? It was decided to conduct a \"lustration\" of personnel - all employees of administrative institutions, trade unions and socio-political organizations that were members of the SED were forbidden to hold positions in the state apparatus.{0}The leaders of the Politburo of the SED were put on trial for \"assisting the killing of Berlin Wall.\" Two Erichs - Mielke and Honecker received life sentences, others - from 10 to 25 years. True, a significant part was amnestied by the end of the 1990s. However, the SED was labeled a \"criminal organization\" and banned.{0}The economy was more difficult, a significant part of East German industry could not compete with Western goods and went bankrupt, as a result of which the federal government had to impose a \"solidarity tax\" that paid every Westerner for \"leveling the situation in the East.\"\r\nDemocratic Germany{0}The unification of the West and the East took place on conditions similar to Stalin's 1952 note.{0}Germany is declared a \"single democratic state\" and officially a neutral country, undertakes not to enter into any coalitions or military alliances directed against any of the countries whose armed forces participated in the war against it.{0}The implementation of these seemingly simple provisions was not obvious. The most important commitment to both Germanys is the holding of free elections. In East Germany, there is no public politics, and all parties are nominated by the Popular Front, where the ruling SED enjoys an apparently privileged position. However, some communist organizations are banned in the FRG, which also leaves its mark on the \"free and unrestricted elections.\" The SPD refused to form a bloc with the SED, just like the other parties decided to run each from their country: as a result, there were two liberal parties and two Christian Democrats in the elections.{0}{1}{0}The elected parliament approved the new German constitution and ratified an agreement on neutrality, according to which troops are withdrawn from both countries.{0}Now the new government will have to decide how to rebuild the German economy...\r\nOstalgia{0}Germany remained divided. On the 40th anniversary of the GDR, German leader Honecker will declare the following: \"The wall will stand for 50 or even 100 years if the reasons for this are not eliminated.\" \r\nThe end of socialism{0}After the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the socialist camp, in East Germany, the Christian Democrats won the elections and announced the unification in Germany and the entry of all the lands of the GDR into the FRG.{0}After such a \"absorption\", a significant part of the East German industry did not was able to withstand competition from Western goods and went bankrupt, as a result of which the federal government had to introduce a \"solidarity tax\" that every Westerner paid to \"level the situation in the East.\"\r\nIn the elections, the bloc of both Christian Democrats received the majority of votes.\r\nIn the elections, the SPD and the SED received the majority of votes.\r\nGermany continued to exist as a confederal state. At first, different currencies were in circulation, and even duties were introduced on goods in order to balance the competitiveness of industries. After the start of reforms in the Soviet Union, Erich Honecker resigned and handed over the leadership of the party to Hans Modrow, who became the architect of the reforms. Against the background of the general democratization of Germany and the stabilization of the situation, the popularity of the CDA fell and the SPD won the elections in West Germany.{0}The governments of both Germanys decided to move towards further integration of the countries into a soft federation with the creation of a national parliament and government.\r\nBut despite the latter's attempt to attract the right-wing electorate, they have had a number of internal party scandals and lost many of their regional cells in protest against \"flirting with the extreme right.\" Thus, the Liberals took 4th place, closing the parliamentary list of three left-wing parties. The result was a parliamentary coalition of the New Labor Party and the Social Democratic Party to form a government. Gordon Brown was appointed prime minister. Thus, the era of Brownism began in Great Britain - economic social liberalism with privatization and reduction in budget spending, but with state regulation of the market \"for the benefit of all.\" The main task of the new government was to \"create more political and cultural equality than economic.\" The economy has become something secondary.\r\nThe latter won the elections, having absorbed the entire electorate of the right field, and then united in a parliamentary bloc with the Social Democratic Party to form a government. Tony Blair was appointed prime minister. Thus began the era of Blairism in the UK - economic centrism with privatization and budget cuts, combined with an aggressive pro-American foreign policy. So first of all, Blair announced the \"pragmatic primacy of the economy over ideology\" and the creation of a personal military-political alliance between the US and Britain.\r\nFive Arab states united in a single state «United Arab Republic». The creation of a new state in the Middle East led to a serious revision of the balance of power - the once pro-British and then pro-American region became the center of Arab unity and the ideology of Arab socialism. The creation of a new state was not without problems, it was difficult to force the charismatic leaders of these countries to accept the new rules of the game, but over time the situation in the region stabilized. A huge state, stretching from West Africa to the Persian Gulf, has become a new contender for the status of an influential world power.\r\nThe dissolution of the Warsaw Pact led the Soviet leadership to the idea that it was no longer possible to keep their satellites only by armed methods and pressure. Since the mid-1980s, in the rest of the countries of the socialist camp, democratic reforms were carried out, which, however, ended unsuccessfully, and although at first the countries were not going to leave the CMEA, after the collapse of the USSR, they had to look for new alternatives and ways of development in a rapidly the changing world.\r\nThe dissolution of the Warsaw Pact led the Soviet leadership to the idea that it was no longer possible to keep their satellites only by armed methods and pressure. Since the mid-1980s, in the rest of the countries of the socialist camp, large-scale democratic and market transformations have been carried out and the countries have remained members of the socialist camp, although the question remains whether there is much socialism left in these countries. \r\nFallen eagle{0}The Iron Curtain has finally fallen. The North Atlantic Alliance has sunk into oblivion and disappeared from the world maps. The countries of Europe freed themselves from American hegemony, and serious changes took place in the United States itself - the country returned to a policy of isolationism and non-interference in European affairs. But who will be the next hegenome of the new world order?{0}{1}\r\nThe times of the greatness of the Soviet Union are coming to an end... A new China will soon take its place...\r\nThe influence of the Soviet Union on the politics of other countries continues to be significant, and it is Moscow that now sets all world trends.\r\nPower of Chernenko:\r\nPower of Andropov:\r\n<color=#DC143C>Construction is progress</color>\r\n<color=lime>Construction is finished</color>\r\nThe Korean People's Army took revenge for 1953, occupying Seoul and finally uniting the peninsula. The American bases have been forced to evacuate, and the remnants of the South Korean army have mostly surrendered, a minority are trying to continue the struggle. Korea is united again - under the rule of the North.\r\nThe South Korean army has completed what had not been completed in 1953 - it has defeated its KPA cronies and taken control of the entire peninsula. The TPK was banned and its leadership fled. The remnants of the North Korean troops partially retreated to Soviet territory and interned, partially turned to guerrilla warfare. Korea is again united - under the rule of the South.\r\nVietnamese troops, supported by units of the United Front for National Salvation of Kampuchea, easily defeated the Kampuchean army and occupied Phnom Penh. The Vietnamese, in agreement with the USSR, put Heng Samrin and Pen Sovan, former Khmer Rouge who had opposed Pol Pot and had been forced to emigrate, at the head of the new People's Republic of Kampuchea; now advocates of Soviet-style socialism, reforms along those lines were already underway, while a large Vietnamese military contingent remained in the country.{0}The new authorities are also preparing a tribunal against the old regime and collecting evidence of \"the work of Pol Pot and his bloody clique for the US imperialists and Beijing revisionists\". The remnants of the Khmer Rouge forces have retreated into the impenetrable jungle and to the border with Thailand, where they have turned to guerrilla warfare. It is known that negotiations are underway between PDFGNUK Khieu Sampfang (Khmer Rouge), General Son Sann's KPNLF (pro-US Republicans) and Prince Norodom Sihanouk's FUNSINPEC (monarchists) to establish a coalition government and unified military command. However, as long as Vietnam supports the PRC - they will not win.\r\nThe Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea, backed by China and the US, was able to wear down the much stronger Vietnamese forces and then expel them from the country. Under pressure from the USSR to avoid getting involved in a new protracted conflict in Indochina, Vietnam was forced to conclude a truce with Democratic Kampuchea, which the Khmer Rouge immediately declared a \"total victory\" and, under that cover, finally destroyed or expelled the Vietnamese minority and gained control of several small border islets.\r\nUnited Communist and Democrat forces broke the resistance of government forces and took control of most of Thailand's territory. King Rama IX was arrested and, under pressure, abdicated the throne (after which he was allowed to leave the country) and the Republic of Thailand was proclaimed. In order to ensure a balance between left- and right-wing forces, it was decided to introduce a parliamentary form of government and to have a Communist prime minister and a Democratic prime minister co-chairman: the first of these were CPP leader Phaiom Chulanont and Thai People's Party chief Chatchai Chunhawan.{0}The country has begun reforms in a people's-democratic spirit, the new authorities intend to begin building a \"socialist society of the Thai spirit\", but in the meantime Thailand has withdrawn from ASEAN and begun strengthening ties with China.\r\nThe People's Liberation Army of Thailand and the democratic opposition units were unable to reach Bangkok and, suffering a series of defeats, were pushed back northward, where they dispersed into guerrilla warfare, and some fled to Burma and Laos. The alliance between the CPP and the Democrats fell apart and Communist leader, Prayom Chulanont, who was gravely ill, was forced to leave Beijing for medical treatment and retired. After gaining power and the support of King Rama IX, the Thai military junta launched a massive crackdown on the opposition, imposed media censorship and destroyed over 45,000 \"harmful\" books. However, the generals have so far failed to stabilise the country's economic fortunes.\r\nThe joint efforts of three superpowers to restrain Islamist Iran by the hands of Iraq have brought results - with difficulties in overcoming the fanatical resistance of Basiji, Iraqi troops have occupied the province of Khuzestan and, having established naval and air blockade of Iran, forced the Ayatollahs to sit down to negotiations. Iran had to give up the disputed territories, and Iraq, exhausted by its enormous loss of manpower, did not insist on more. Victory in the war significantly strengthened Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime and freed up resources to fight the Shiite and Kurdish insurgents, while the secular opposition in Iran revived and the Iranian Mujahedeen Organization, taking advantage of the Persian army's poor condition, began to gain influence in the Kurdish and Azeri-speaking regions.\r\nThanks to Chinese assistance, Iranian forces were able to break through the front, take Basra and launch an offensive in Iraqi Kurdistan, forcing Iraq to withdraw. However, due to poor organisation by the Iraqi command, the withdrawal turned into a panicked flight, amid which Persian-Kurdish units reached Baghdad. Iraqi generals arrested Saddam Hussein and began negotiations with Tehran, but the latter refused a truce and, taking advantage of the collapse of the Iraqi army, quickly occupied key Iraqi cities. Now an \"Islamic revolution\" of its own is emerging in annexed Iraq, with Saddam awaiting trial and, most likely, execution. Iran is undergoing a patriotic upheaval, against which the ayatollahs' opponents are finally losing political influence and the Iranian Mujahedeen Organization, which has lost its bases in Iraq, is effectively collapsing.\r\nIsrael achieved its objectives by stabilising the situation in Lebanon - the PLO and its subsidiaries had to evacuate their camps there, which markedly weakened their influence in the Middle East. But it did not stop there, as the IDF also defeated Muslim groups in Lebanon and forced the Syrian troops to withdraw after occupying Beirut. The Christian phalangists who came to power massacred the Muslim population and Lebanon lost its independence, becoming a single \"security zone\" of Israel.\r\nThe IDF's attempt to intervene in the ongoing confrontation in Lebanon between the Christian phalangists on the one hand and the Lebanese Muslims, the PLO and Syrian troops on the other ended in failure - Israeli forces never reached Beirut and were unable to clear the PLO camps and were driven back into Israeli territory. The position of the Falangists deteriorated markedly after that, allowing the PLO and its affiliates to increase their control of Lebanese territory and increase pressure on Israel. Perhaps it will now be more accommodating towards the establishment of a Palestinian state. \r\nAfghan civil war\r\nDRA\r\nMujahedeen\r\nWith the active participation of the socialist camp, the Afghan government overpowered numerous mujahedeen groups and more or less regained control over most of the country. The remnants of the Afghan opposition forces have retreated into the mountains and Pakistan, from where they now and then attack communications. Immediately after winning the war, the conflict between Khalqis and Parchamists in the PDPA revived - the unpopular Babrak Karmal had to give up his post to the ethnic Pashtun Mohammad Najibullah, who began a more systematic socialist transformation and integration of Islamic clergy and moderate opposition circles into political life. Soviet troops remained in Afghanistan for the time being to ensure its security.\r\nThe Maoist insurgents were confronted by DRA government forces, numerous Mujahedeen factions and Soviet troops, but they received strong military assistance from China - which enabled them to quickly equalise their forces and, defeating their opponents in a series of clashes, take Kabul and the main cities of Afghanistan. The USSR had to curtail its military engagement and withdraw its troops to avoid the conflict turning into a war with the PRC, while the remaining Maoist enemies retreated into the mountains and turned to guerrilla warfare. The new leadership began to rebuild Afghanistan along Chinese lines.\r\nThe Afghan opposition, despite strenuous opposition from the Soviets, was able, with U.S. support, to take control of most of the country and then (after the betrayal of Abdul Rashid Dustum) of Kabul. The Mujahideen overthrew the PDPA (its leadership fled to the USSR), proclaimed the Islamic State of Afghanistan and established the Jihad Council regime headed by the Islamist Sebghatullah Mujadidi. However, the Pashtun, Tajik and Uzbek Mujahidin groups, left without a common enemy, have already begun to fight each other over power and cash flows. The Tajiks, represented by Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ahmad Shah Masood, have the largest shares in this struggle, but so far the conflict has not entered an active phase.\r\nThe Afghan Maoist insurgency, ill-conceived and hastily mounted, encountered a united front of the DRA government forces, numerous factions of mujahedin and Soviet troops, forced to temporarily form an alliance against the pro-Chinese forces. It has proved impossible to cope with such opposition - the remnants of the Maoists are now trying to escape from the country via the mountain paths of the Pamirs and reach China. And the DRA and the Mujahideen have lost no time in resuming hostilities with each other.\r\nThanks to military assistance from China and partly from France, the Argentine forces managed to hold the Malvinas Islands, sinking one of the two British aircraft carriers, several escort ships and landing craft. Having suffered significant losses and wasting time, the British command called off the operation, recalling the ships and acknowledging de facto the loss of the islands. The British defeat severely damaged Margaret Thatcher's rating and provoked a new wave of mass protests and strikes against the Conservative neoliberal government, against which Labour and the Liberals strengthened their position.\r\nAs might be expected, the English navy had little trouble in taking back the Falklands, losing two destroyers and two frigates (against the light cruiser General Belgrano, the submarine Santa Fe and a patrol boat to the Argentines). There was a parade in London to honour the Royal Navy and Margaret Thatcher's government ratings increased significantly, effectively guaranteeing the Conservative Party victory at the next election. The Argentine leadership has not given up its claim to the islands, but now has to deal with angry patriots who have been defeated.\r\nThe United Front government, supported by a large section of the Indian army, managed to consolidate its forces and crush the organised resistance of Naxalite gangs and all sorts of nationalists. In the Northern and North-Eastern states of India, where the positions of the left-wing radical nationalist bloc are strong, instability remains, but on the whole the situation is under control. India's leadership has announced deepening of socialist reforms and rapprochement with China, which the Indians now view as their leading ally against the USSR and the US. However, this does not mean that the issue of the territorial ownership of Arunachal Pradesh is resolved.\r\nThe anti-government uprising raised by the Naxalites and the nationalists who had joined them was successful - the troops sent by the United Front to the northern states deserted en masse or joined the rebels, which enabled them to launch an attack on Delhi and take control of most of the country without much trouble. The Indian government and leaders of the CPI and CPI(M) fled to the USSR and China, in a number of states pro-communist forces continue to resist, but on the whole they have lost the war. Surprisingly, the Naxalite-Nationalist alliance has not collapsed since victory - they have managed to form a coalition government and agree on a national-socialist reform programme, with the new Indian leadership oriented on the US in foreign policy, inviting US military advisers and investors to the country.\r\nPutting the controversies aside, the INC, Janata Party and the CPI were able to join hands and crush the Naxalite uprising. The Naxalist CPI(m-l) was banned and its members were repressed. The authorities did not succeed in taking complete control of the northern states of India, but they overcame the active phase of the conflict. However, the Naxalite insurrection forced the authorities to speed up agrarian reforms and also appeal to the USSR for additional military and economic aid.\r\nHaving gained enough strength with Chinese help, the Naxalites were able to form strong units and launch an offensive from the north of India against Delhi. After it became obvious that it could not be stopped - the Indian government fled to the USSR and most of the army went over to the Naxalites. In a number of states where the position of the INC, Janata Party and CPI is particularly strong, resistance continues, but without any central leadership, moreover - the former government parties blamed each other for the defeat and managed to haggle, making it even easier for the Naxalites to defeat them finally. The new authorities have embarked on a significant socialist transformation and have expectedly embarked on a course of rapprochement with China. Shall we request Arunachal Pradesh from them?\r\nThe war is over, but for how long?\r\nThanks to our help, most of the countries of the former Warsaw Pact threw off their shackles and joined our alliance.\r\nLittle Rome. \r\nIn the late 1930s, the Italians transformed the landscape of Eritrea by creating new infrastructure and constructing buildings. As a result, the capital of Eritrea, Asmara, earned the nickname \"Little Rome.\" Today, the majority of the buildings in Asmara are of Italian origin, and the shops still bear Italian names such as \"Bar Vittoria,\" \"Pasticceria moderna,\" \"Casa del fromaggio,\" and \"Ferramenta.\" Italian pizza has become a ubiquitous and everyday food, with pizzerias often found on every corner. After a half-year of Eritreans fighting for independence from Ethiopia, the Italian government under Romualdi has decided to revive old relations. Despite protests from the United Nations and the Soviet Union, new agreements have been signed with Eritrea. In exchange for investing in road and building renovations, constructing new infrastructure, and providing armed assistance, Eritrea has committed to offering favorable tax and economic conditions for Italian companies involved in the extraction and processing of various resources for the next 49 years.\r\nCondemn Italian imperialism's intervention. \r\nSend immediate aid to Ethiopia. \r\nProvide assistance to Eritrea in exchange for tariff reductions.\r\nWe strongly condemn the resurgence of Italian imperialism and its neo-colonial policies in Africa. However, the criticism received has not influenced the actions of the Italians, as they continue their destructive activities and have already dispatched the first shipment of weapons and military advisors to Asmara.\r\nIn our fight against Italian imperialism and its attempts to reintroduce neo-colonialism in Africa, we have sent additional weapons and food aid to the Ethiopian government, hoping that it will be of assistance. Meanwhile, the Italians have already sent the first batch of weapons and military advisors to Asmara.\r\nRecognizing the opportunity that has presented itself, we have decided not to remain idle. We offered Eritrea a shipment of our weapons and food in exchange for a 10-year agreement to reduce tariffs on our goods. The Eritrean authorities have naturally agreed to this proposal. Consequently, the Italians have sent the first batch of weapons and military advisors to Asmara.\r\nUnder the influence of Italian assistance, Eritrea gradually merged with the economy of Italy, becoming a unified entity. Tariffs and duties were abolished, and unified customs, labor, and other economic codes were established. Ultimately, a single market between Eritrea and Italy was created, governed by uniform rules and laws. Numerous Italian institutions, educational establishments, and corporate branches were established within the country. However, Eritrea retained its own government and citizenship. The former was to appease the local population, while the latter was to prevent mixed marriages and offspring. Moreover, to prevent the latter, an amendment to the citizenship deprivation article was enacted in Italy: citizenship could now be revoked for having a child with a partner who did not possess Italian citizenship. Thus, Eritrea became the \"African Rome\" - economically, architecturally, and culturally - cementing its position as a second Italy.\r\nRepublic of Korea\r\nChina's influence should be above 35.0 OR there is cooperation with the CIA\r\nPresident of the USSR\r\nPodgorny, one of the active initiators of the removal of Khrushchev, had long endeavoured to be the second man in the USSR and even demanded to be called President. During this time, appointed Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, he sought to expand his powers and promote his developments. Speaking from the position of maintaining the monopoly of state bodies over the economy Podgorny repeatedly criticised Kosygin's economic reform programme. At the same time, he was repeatedly seen making odious speeches: Podgorny criticised the sale of oil and gas to Western countries as \"squandering the wealth of Siberia\" and opposed the policy of détente, which provoked a conflict with Andropov. The latter was extremely negative towards Podgorny also because he feared that amid Brezhnev's illness Podgorny could make his way into the leadership of the USSR and oust all the old cadres. Podgorny also had conflicting relations with the \"young\" party members - Romanov, Gorbachev, Ligachev. And even with Shcherbitsky, who has a dislike for Podgorny because the latter defended the previous leader of Ukraine, Shelest, who was known for defending dissidents of pro-bourgeois and anti-Soviet orientation. However, we had received information that Brezhnev and his entourage were planning to intensify work on a new draft of the Constitution and to reduce the powers of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and send Podgornyy into retirement. We wouldn't be able to do much about it, but Podgorny is characterised by personal cowardice and we can take advantage of this by passing all the information we know through diplomatic channels to people loyal to Podgorny.\r\nPass on all the information and spin it a little.\r\nIssue a critical pamphlet against Podgorny.\r\nDo nothing.\r\nRequires 10.0 agents and 5.0 money.\r\nHaving obtained the information he needed, Podgorny acted immediately: first he published an article in the newspapers praising Brezhnev as a great leader who had corrected all of Khrushchev's mistakes and ensured that the country was truly collectively governed, as Lenin had bequeathed. With this article Podgorny hoped to temporarily delay the attack of his opponents, as otherwise his resignation would have looked like a mockery of the proclaimed principles of collective governance. At the same time, Podgorny began to try to revive his old contacts and establish relations with new ones, using the powers of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, since all the \"submitters\" for making any changes or adopting (albeit formal) new decisions passed through his hands. But this situation reached its escalation in early 1977, when Brezhnev went into hospital and Suslov replaced him. At the same time Andropov tried to prepare a plot to remove Podgorny, but was unsuccessful - Podgorny negotiated or at least neutralised the grievances of many party figures, and at the XXV Congress of the CPSU he himself was the first to support the draft of the new Constitution and the reduction of his own powers, which finally knocked the ground out from under the feet of his enemies. Thus, yes, the new Constitution reduced the powers of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, but the whole situation allowed Podgorny to stay in his post, thus confusing all the cards and plans of Andropov, Shcherbitsky and \"young cadres\". However, in 1980 Podgorny was diagnosed with lung cancer. This coincided with Kosygin's repeated myocardial infarctions. And in October 1980 Kosygin resigned from all posts voluntarily for health reasons, and 2 months after Kosygin's death Podgorny, who was no longer needed by anyone, was criticised at the XXVI Congress of the CPSU by the decision of the Congress and forcibly retired for health reasons.\r\nWe published a pamphlet in the Renmin Zhibao newspaper criticising Podgorny as a bourgeois nationalist, a voluntarist and a petty tyrant who was \"destroying all the foundations of Soviet statehood left over from Stalin's time\". At the same time, we did not criticise other party members of the USSR in the article, which had a positive effect on our relations with Brezhnev's ruling group.\r\nHaving learnt too late about the proposed changes to the Constitution to reduce his powers Podgorny tried his best to oppose it, which only accelerated his resignation. At the very beginning of 1976, a few weeks before the XXV Congress of the CPSU, Brezhnev's health suddenly deteriorated so much that he fell into a state of clinical death. Podgorny, who learnt about the General Secretary's ill health, decided to visit the leader alone. However, he was not allowed into the ward attending physician General Secretary Chazov, referring to the fact that Brezhnev needs peace. But in the inner circle of Brezhnev such initiative Podgorny considered sacrilegious and instructed the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPU Shcherbitsky to prepare the defeat of Podgorny. Soon opened the XXV Congress of the Party, by which the doctors managed to put Brezhnev on his feet. Podgorny did not expect a trick and, when right at the Congress he was hit by a deafening stream of criticism from the secretaries of regional committees, confused turned to Brezhnev: \"Lyonya, what's going on?\" The wily Brezhnev made a surprised face: \"I don't understand it myself, Kolya, apparently the people want it that way.\" On 24 May 1977, the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, at the suggestion of Grigory Romanov, unanimously removed Podgorny from its membership, leaving him a member of the Central Committee. On 16 June 1977, Nikolai Podgorny resigned as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, retiring.\r\nConstitution 1977\r\nThe development of a new constitution of the USSR began as early as 1962. For a very long time it was developed in a sluggish mode. Active work began only in March 1977, after a personal reminder from Leonid Brezhnev. In early April, Konstantin Chernenko was assigned to supervise the finalisation of the project. Soon the Politburo recommended the Supreme Soviet to make a decision and at the same time to change the text of the anthem of the Soviet Union (after Khrushchev's revelations about Stalin, it was sung without words). As a result of the nationwide discussion (8 million amendments were proposed by the people), 117 out of 174 articles of the draft Constitution were amended. This Constitution strengthened the one-party political system of the USSR (Article 6 on the leading role of the CPSU), but also introduced many progressive changes: labour collectives were recognised as legal public organisations, the rights to free health care, to free housing, to enjoy cultural achievements, to free education of all kinds (including evening education and self-education) were guaranteed, and for the first time such forms of \"direct democracy\" as national discussion and referendum were prescribed. New civil rights were also added: the right to appeal against the actions of officials and to judicial protection against infringement of honour and dignity. In addition to the right to labour, the right to choose a profession, occupation and work in accordance with a citizen's vocation, abilities, professional training and education, and taking into account public needs, was now prescribed. At the same time, the duties of citizens to protect nature, to care for the preservation of historical monuments and cultural values, and the international duty to promote friendship and co-operation with the peoples of other countries and to maintain and strengthen universal peace were added.\r\nAdopt the progressive articles of the Constitution\r\nCriticise the new Constitution for consumerism\r\nDo nothing.\r\nWe have incorporated into our Constitution the guaranteed material rights of citizens that appeared in the USSR Constitution, as well as their new duties. Although such changes may well remain a mere formality, these reforms have strengthened our citizens' faith in our government, but have provoked criticism from left-wing politicians who accuse us of pandering to philistinism and petty-bourgeois ethics.\r\nWe published a pamphlet in the Renmin Zhibao newspaper criticising the new Soviet constitution, accusing the Soviet authorities of indulging in philistinism and petty-bourgeois ethics instead of strengthening work with the masses, propaganda and a revolutionary way of life. \"The Soviet authorities are trying to bourgeoisise their own population by paying excessive attention to material goods rather than to the development of a revolutionary way of life,\" was the main thesis of the article. Naturally, the Soviet leadership and our more moderate politicians took a negative view of this rhetoric.\r\nOn 4-6 October 1977, the Constitution was heard at the sessions of the chambers of the Supreme Soviet. On 7 October, a final joint session of the chambers of the USSR Supreme Soviet was held, where first section by section and then as a whole the Constitution was adopted. On the same day the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, by separate voting by chambers, adopted the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the adoption and declaration of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR, the Law of the USSR on declaring the day of adoption of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR a national holiday, and the Law of the USSR on the procedure for enacting the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR. On 8 October, the new Constitution of the USSR was published in all newspapers of the country.\r\n"
