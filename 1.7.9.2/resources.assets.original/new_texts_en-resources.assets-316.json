However, now, we must do everything so that our efforts are not in vain: to direct the influence we have received on the establishment of such a popular government in a single Korea that would suit us and the Korean people.\r\nIf our past policy was a mistake, then it is possible to achieve complete harmony between all citizens of China thanks to the project of autonomy of Tibet. Naturally, we are not going to allow their barbaric traditions of slavery and backward methods of agriculture.\r\nTibetans are not a nation, but the name of slave-owning feudal lords who oppressed their own people. We must erase all traces of their terrible history: monasteries, monuments, monks' schools. We will send the children to orphanages to keep them away from harmful influences, and we will send Tibetan adults to re-education camps, where they will atone for their sins by working hard for the good of the motherland.\r\nTo solve the ethnic problem with the resident Uighurs, a cautious approach should be taken, granting them broad autonomy. First, however, it must be decided which authorities will be established there, so as not to lose the region.\r\nThe main cause of ethnic problems is the archaic culture of the Uyghurs, which has lagged behind in time due to their long isolation in the mountains. This archaicism should be eliminated by all means and the light of a new modern civilization should be brought to them.\r\nThe constant, permanent reshuffling of personnel by the old methods cannot work forever. Under new conditions, a model of a new personnel policy of our country should be developed.\r\nNow that we have shown the world our good will, we can take advantage of the Americans' desire to distance us as far as possible from the USSR by demanding Taiwan in return.\r\nWe are stronger than ever before, and the Americans are extremely weak. The time has come to take back Taiwan. Americans are afraid of a full-fledged war and are unlikely to defend their «allies».\r\nNow that we have made peace with the Soviet Union, we can rehabilitate Lin Biao not only to appease the USSR, but also, by making him a great hero-soldier, inspire Maoists around the world to fight for their ideals to the end.\r\nThe Warsaw Pact, after the change of power in Poland, Hungary, and the final distancing of the Romanian leadership from the USSR, is not having its best years, and China is becoming more and more vocal about itself as a new superpower. So let us recall Enlai's old idea of isolating the Soviet Union from the West, pushing our new allies to withdraw from this social-imperialist bloc of revisionism...\r\nNow that we have full control of all of Afghanistan's borders, we can completely cut off all aid, supplies and bandit arrivals to the Afghan mujahideen, thereby achieving a solution to the Afghan civil war in the most efficient way possible.\r\nA group of moderate reformers, not too numerous, but now extremely strong, was finally able to come to power legally, pushing their rivals aside. Their leader's initial goals were to reform the economy in a manner analogous to the NEP, with extensive state control and preservation of party discipline, but time will tell...\r\nThe oligarchs have become a powerful force of the state and may even soon begin to compete for power. If you can't stop them, take the lead, so we should seize the initiative and impose a treaty on our terms while we can still afford it.\r\nNow that Wang Ming's arguments have been heard again in his native China, a renewed Communist Party must not allow liberals and neo-Marxists to seize power in the young People's Republic of China. We must use all tools and leverage to defend and preserve the Party's course toward socialism and communism!\r\nNow that the people of India are extremely dissatisfied with their leaders, and the Naxalites, thanks to our support, have great influence, we can organize the first successful Maoist revolution outside of China in a country as large as India. Only we need to be careful, because there is still no unity in the ranks of the Naxalites...\r\n-\r\n-\r\n-\r\nAgent networks\r\nBudget\r\nUnitarianism Doctrine - \r\nThe liberal faction is the leading/ the liberal political line of the party -\r\nThe left-wing radical faction is leading/ reformist faction/ authoritarian party line with multi-party democracy - \r\nFighting Traditionalism/ Concordat - \r\nArmy power\r\nFaction Allowed.\r\nOne Party/ New Democracy.\r\nHua Guofeng, Deng Xiaoping and the Gang of Four not in politics\r\nSigned autonomy for Macao and Hong Kong\r\nAttacked Taiwan's disputed islands\r\nNot in the CFA.\r\nNot in the CMEA. \r\nCultural Revolution modifier\r\nModifier Opposition to Maoism\r\nDipreputation\r\nAnnexed Macau and Hong Kong\r\nU.S. Influence\r\nInfluence of the USSR\r\nInfluence of China\r\nTotal militarization/Improvement of power\r\nLeft-radical at the helm of China\r\nMaoist version of \"The Decision\" is adopted\r\nNo Grishin or Gorbachev in the USSR\r\nCommunist at the head of China\r\nExtended treaty of friendship with the USSR\r\nPoland, Rumania and Hungary have a positive attitude towards us\r\nGorbachev/Ligachev rules in the USSR\r\nThe required year. \r\nThere is a war going on called.\r\nModerate faction leads\r\nA moderate/reformist faction leads China\r\nLeft-wing radicals are banned\r\nEconomy to the right of the Birdcage\r\nInfluence of the oligarchy\r\nKhrushchev's version of \"The Solution\" is adopted\r\nNot a left-radical, not a reformer, not a liberal at the head of China\r\nHelped Janata in India and then abandoned them during the split\r\nNaxalite strength in India\r\nCauses an event.\r\nWill change loyalties in all faction politicians\r\nLeft-wing radicals\r\nModerates \r\nReformers\r\nLiberals\r\nWill change the relationship with the\r\nTibet will no longer be able to secede\r\nWill change China's influence\r\nWill change the state of the budget\r\nWill change the state of patriotism\r\nWill change the size of the population\r\nXinjiang will no longer be able to secede\r\n- comes under our sphere of influence.\r\n- changes the state system to\r\nauthoritarianism\r\nsocialism\r\nreformism\r\nliberalism\r\n- falls under U.S. influence\r\n- be within the sphere of influence of the USSR\r\n- be annexed by the USSR\r\nWill change the level of liberalization of the masses\r\nWill change the influence (power) of all faction politicians\r\nMaoist support in the West now increases Chinese influence\r\n- enters the OECD\r\n- enters the CMEA\r\n- enters UCB\r\n- enters ECO\r\nChange the influence of the U.S.\r\nChange the influence of the USSR\r\nSupport for the Maoists in the East will now increase China's influence\r\nWill no longer be able to participate in a war called\r\nWill change popular support\r\nWill change the standard of living of the population\r\nWill leave politics faction leader\r\nIs in politics\r\nThe power of the oligarchs will never be able to rise above 70 and fall below 40\r\nOpen bourgeois doctrines will no longer be available\r\nWill become head of state\r\nInactive\r\nKim Jong Il - father's heir\r\nKim Pyong Il - Managed Candidate\r\nKim Yong-hwan - Juche with an Outside View\r\nKwon Yong Gil - It's time to give up Juche\r\nKorea is finally united and united under our ally. It was only and only thanks to our help that North Korea won, because the Soviet Union did not really want to intervene in a new conflict, and the DPRK had no other big friends. And, during this war, our specialists, advisers, officers not only flooded the apparatus of a unified DPRK, but gained significant control over the country. And, thanks to this control, we will be able to determine the further path of development of the new united Korea. And we have 4 candidates: two sons of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il - the clear successor of his father and Kim Pyon Il, on whom we have dirt; as well as two South Korean candidates - Kim Yong-hwan, the leader of the so-called \"South Korean Juche sect\", and Kwon Yong-gil, an anti-American left-wing trade unionist who believes that Juche is an anti-proletarian ideology.\r\nOne and Indivisible\r\nInsufficient agents and money required: {0}\r\nNo Maoism, no cultural revolution and agents: {0}\r\nKim Jong Il has long been promoted as Kim Il Sung's heir, and his appointment as head of a unified Korea while his father remains head of the Workers' Party is a natural continuation of events and is unlikely to lead to any significant changes in Korean politics. But we don't need that, do we?\r\nKim Pyong Il, brother of Kim Jong Il, was a noble reveler in his youth, for which he fell out of favor with his father. But now, under our influence, we can promote him to the head of a unified Korea, thus, in fact, he will become our direct puppet. Who would he be without us, and even with such compromising evidence?!\r\nKim Yong-hwam has long been the leader of the so-called \"Juche sect\" in South Korea and is an excellent candidate for a bi-national figure: an activist, a Marxist, an inquisitive and creative worker's rights activist. He will be a worthy candidate, accepted by all.\r\nKwon Yong-gil, a journalist and leader of the anti-American, anti-colonial and anti-authoritarian left-wing labor union movement, would fit in well with the leadership of a united Korea whose wounds of difference can only be healed by such an understanding and versatile politician. Moreover, he has contacts with all trade union movements in South Korea and the Marxist People's Democracy movement, which will allow us to calm down any resistance and discontent in South Korea as soon as possible.\r\nUnited Korea\r\nNo changes have shaken Korea enough to change something radically.\r\nAfter the death of Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il assumed full power. However, not everything went so smoothly - underground right-wing nationalist resistance unfolded in South Korea, and the party apparatus of the WPK (replenished at the expense of the South Korean left) was washed away by supporters of negotiations with the underground. To solve this problem, the ruling group developed the Songun ideology, literally meaning \"Army First\". According to the new policy, it was the army that was declared the driving political and social force, the vanguard of the struggle against imperialism and the success of the last Korean war. The people and the WPK were subordinate to the State Defense Committee of the DPRK, and he, in turn, was subordinate to the Leader. Along with the tightening of repressive policies, Kim Jong Il legalized small businesses and rock concerts. The policy of carrot and stick brought significant success in appeasing the rebels, but created a cult of personality of the Leader and the army, suppressing all civil activity in the country.\r\nWith the death of Kim Il Sung, thanks to our support, Kim Pyong Il finally removed Kim Jong Il from power and sent him as ambassador to Finland, leading the WPK. Then the party was purged of \"counter-revolutionary elements\" who allegedly were preparing a \"coup d'état.\" After that, agreements on the broadest economic integration were signed between China and Korea: the abolition of customs barriers, a single currency, economic space and a foreign trade body. Although the Western media spread dirty gossip that Korea was actually absorbed by China, in fact, the economic integration of the two countries gave a big impetus to the closed Korean economy, which, although it is becoming more and more an appendage of China, the Korean people also receive many preferences from integration in the form a steadily rising standard of living.\r\nKim Yong-hwan and his associates, activists of the left workers' trade union movement, were the so-called in South Korea. secret \"Juche sect\", seeking to rid their country of US imperialism and reunite with North Korea. Appointed to leadership positions after the unification, they were at first in close contact with Kim Il Sung and the old cadres of the WPK, but then gradually began to organize themselves into an independent faction. By the time of Kim Il Sung's death, the South Korean \"Jucheists\" had finally formed into an independent group and were disappointed in the resulting state system of the DPRK, as \"not democratic enough and not working enough.\" With the death of the permanent leader of the WPK, they attacked Kim Jong Il's group and were able to defeat it. But, having taken power, the former members of the \"Juche sect\" came up with unexpected reforms: the debunking of the cult of Kim Il Sung, the rejection of Juche (as an \"ideology degenerated into an anti-Soviet dictatorship of the Kim family\"), the democratization of the United Trade Unions of Korea (renunciation of mandatory membership in the WPK for membership in the trade union, democratic elections of leaders of socio-political organizations from the bottom up, freedom of discussion and opinion) and the involvement of workers in government (active participation of trade union representatives in the appointment of directors of enterprises, drawing up five-year plans, election to the Supreme People's Assembly). Officially, Korea is now declaring \"a return to the path of Marxism-Leninism\" and we will be watching closely to see how successful their reforms are.\r\nKwon Yong-gil and his associates in the underground People's Democratic Party gained control of the government of the United Korea, but more in its southern part. To confront the Juche supporters, the new authorities began to rely on the South Korean National Council of Trade Unions, promoting its activists to high-ranking posts. After the death of Kim Il Sung, the People's Democrats entered into a coalition with the moderate Jucheists who opposed the transfer of power to the children of Kim Il Sung, and then hit them too, organizing broad popular discussions of the legacy of Juche and the personality of Kim Il Sung. Having eliminated any threat in their path, the neo-Marxists put forward the idea of ​​transferring economic power to the trade union movement, introducing alternative elections to Councils at all levels, including Althusser and Sartre in the program of Marxist theory. The syndicalization of the economy and the liberalization of power led to a massive victory for the supporters of the New Deal, whose task for the coming five-year period was to create an economic system based on the works of Kardelj and Režeő Nyersch, and a political system based on the ideas of the Austro-Marxists and the Budapest School. Orthodox communist movements are already predicting the collapse of the new regime, while neo-Marxist philosophers and intellectuals are looking forward to the fact that somewhere far away in the East, the implementation of their newfangled ideas for the first time begins at the state level.\r\nTibetan autonomy\r\nNo changes have shaken Tibet so much that something has changed radically in it.\r\nTibet under the X Panchen Lama became an exemplary province for all the autonomous regions of China - stable, loyal and not getting involved in the affairs of the center. The local government of Tibet dealt exclusively with internal affairs, not related to political issues, focusing on the development of agriculture, monasteries and spiritual schools. No worries, no tension, we are happy with our choice.\r\nUnder the Dalai Lama XIV, Tibet completely changed and became a unique province: on one side of the road there could be a temple with ascetics and peasantry, as if from the 19th century, and on the other - a large shopping center. All this happened because the new Lama supported the restoration and preservation of traditional Tibet, while at the same time ensuring the opening of Free Economic Zones to attract foreign business (which used Tibet's cheap labor resources). A developed infrastructure was laid in the country, electricity penetrated into every corner of the country, but few ordinary Tibetans could afford popular brands of cars or imported furniture. Tibet became a syncretism of progress and retrograde, a complete embodiment of the philosophy of the new government - moderate Tibetan nationalism, reliance on Buddhist monks and the bourgeoisie. At the same time, the Dalai Lama had already managed to declare Buddhism ideologically close to socialism and used the monasteries that had proliferated throughout the region as elementary schools, medical camps and centers to help the homeless and hungry. Tibet has drastically changed and is moving, but as long as we do not interfere much in the internal affairs of Tibet, Tibet will be completely subordinate to us.\r\nTibet under the Hambo Lama became not only the center of Soviet-Russian influence in the region, but also flourished significantly: poverty and illiteracy were completely eliminated, the reactionary traditions of the peasantry were uprooted, and the population adopted the version of Buddhism that calls for peace, solidarity and community . New schools, religious institutions, hospitals, high-rise buildings, albeit built according to the Soviet model, flourished brightly in the region. And despite the fact that Soviet-Russian organizations of the world lodge in Tibet, which are clearly used to promote their interests in Asia, Tibet itself remains the most loyal autonomy to our central government, and the Khambo Lama does not allow the appointment of any persons with an anti-Chinese attitude to the Tibetan government. and anti-Beijing orientation. Peace in a Buddhist way, peace, according to the Hambo Lama, is not only world peace, but also the harmonious coexistence of Tibetans and all other peoples of China.\r\nUyghur leader\r\nNow that we have decided to form the Uyghur Republic and give it the ability to have its own government, we should decide who will form it. There are three candidates: Saifuddin Azizi, a Uighur communist leader of the national liberation revolution of the 1940s, an active supporter of friendship with the USSR, who suffered during the Cultural Revolution. We could rehabilitate him, because he never expressed secessionist sentiments. The second option is Burkhan Shakhidi, an open Muslim and, also, a communist figure in the national liberation revolution of the 40s, however, unlike the previous candidate, this person is not only engaged in protecting the Chinese fauna, but also speaks out with anti-Soviet and extremely pro-Chinese positions. He is clearly the best candidate, but if we are persecuting religion, then we will have to relax these measures. And the last candidate is a prominent figure in the Uyghur movement in exile, the son of one of the participants in the pro-Kuomintang Uyghur Republic of the 1940s, a former Radio Liberty employee and a former CIA adviser for the China region. He supports the national self-determination not only of the Uyghurs, but of all small peoples. However, by now this candidate already takes a moderate position on secession - speaking in favor of autonomy, not secession, and the use of only peaceful means. If we are not afraid of American influence, then this is an excellent candidate to show the whole world how we protect human rights.\r\nSaifuddin Azizi\r\nBurhan Shahidi\r\nErkin Alptekin\r\nRelations with the USSR were restored\r\nSigned Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the USA or Confederation or Union of Autonomies\r\nAfter the complete rehabilitation of Saifuddin Azizi, he was first appointed head of the reconstituted Soviet-Chinese Friendship Committee and the Chinese-Pakistani Friendship Committee, and then, after being tested for loyalty, he was instructed to form a new government of the Uighur autonomy. As part of the position entrusted to him, he took up the ennoblement of Uyghuristan on the model of Soviet Central Asia - a secular state, where the place of religion was only at home and in mosques, a state of high literacy, a wide range of scientific institutions, internationalism while maintaining non-reactionary variants of the Uyghur culture. The Chinese language became mandatory for learning, the network of Uyghur schools with teaching in the Uyghur language expanded, while the Russian language became an optional (optional) language for study No. 1. In general, the new government took a course towards secularization and enlightenment, a general cultural upsurge.\r\nAfter the restoration of the government of the Uighur Republic, Burkhan became an excellent candidate for this role - a loyal, executive Sinophile. Under his leadership, the Uyghur constitution was written, which limited the powers of the Uyghur government to a minimum, and his new administration took up priority issues for the preservation of Uyghur culture - the restoration of mosques and holy places, the protection of wildlife, the familiarization of all Uyghurs with the Chinese language and the thousand-year heritage of the achievements of the Chinese nation. Meanwhile, his government picked up some anti-Soviet theses of the Uighur political emigration, in particular, about the suppression of the Turkic community by the revisionist Soviet administration and the \"forced division of the Turkic peoples\", which worries our Soviet neighbors.\r\nThe invitation of Erkin Alptekin to the government of the Uighur Republic was really a surprise for the world community. His most moderate comrades joined their colleague, having previously signed an agreement with Beijing on the rejection of secession and separatism. Having received full power in the region, the new government quickly began to restore and even plant the \"repressed\" Uyghur culture, in particular, books, newspapers, media, advertising were translated exclusively into the Uyghur language, and Chinese-language schools were replaced by Uyghur-speaking ones. At the same time, the government turned out to be secular and did not become obsessed with Islam, which reduced the intensity of anxiety of the Chinese central authorities.\r\nUyghur autonomy\r\nNo changes have shaken Xinjiang so much that something has changed radically in it.\r\nThe Uighur Republic was completely transformed under Saifuddin Azizi: where there used to be villages and pastures, urban-type settlements and streets full of high-rise buildings flourished; where there used to be many mosques, there are now many hospitals, schools and institutes; where famous pastoralists and farmers used to be, now famous doctors, scientists and professors originate. Urumqi became the Tashkent of Eastern China, and any official of the new autonomous republic became ashamed to go to work or perform without official civilian clothes. Perhaps someday later, radical Islam will be completely eradicated in the region, but for now, citizens and Beijing are satisfied with such a massive progress and therefore turn a blind eye to the flirting of the Uyghur government with the governments of Central Asian countries.\r\nThe Uighur Republic remained a loyal region of China under Burhan Shahidi. He suppressed in every possible way any resistance, any ideas of dissent, secretly completely subordinating all religious and spiritual figures of the region to the Uyghur government. Using spiritual methods, he did not forget to actively introduce the Uyghurs to Chinese culture, history, and traditions, taking on the role of Kemal of China, but if Kemal Europeanized the Turks in order to get them out of the \"disease of backwardness\", then Shahidi Chineseized the Uyghurs. His spiritually repressive policy not only made it possible to completely subjugate the region to Beijing, but also opened up new previously inaccessible opportunities for the spread of Chinese influence in the Turkic world. For China, as the world hegemon, everything is just beginning!\r\nUnder Erkin Alptekin, the Uyghur Republic began to change: coats and caftans were replaced by business suits, peasants became farmers, and those who were unlucky began to work in the factories of foreign campaigns in the newly opened Free Economic Zones. As a student of a European Catholic school, Erkin allowed foreign religious missionaries of various faiths into the country, maintaining religious freedom but not allowing any religious institution to take over. At the same time, Catholic and Islamic charitable organizations opened up in the region, taking on the main responsibility for improving the welfare of the population. At the same time, the new government made great efforts to restore and glorify the ancient Uyghur culture - up to renaming streets, cities, placing new monuments and introducing a special lesson on \"Uyghur history\" as a mandatory subject for final exams. By no means claiming any diplomatic relations and foreign policy independence, Erkin turned the Uighur autonomy not into the Turkey of the 1930s, but into the Turkey of the 1980s: a strict, disciplined state with a mixed economy and moderate nationalism.\r\nWill change the result of the state of the country\r\nTibetans, due to their small numbers, very quickly disappeared into history under our new policy: the children of families whose loyalty was not confirmed (and almost all of them were) were sent to special orphanages in eastern China, where they were weaned from being Tibetans; their parents were sent to do compulsory labor work building infrastructure in Tibet until they could pass the test of Chineseness and loyalty; the descendants of the Tibetan aristocracy were executed immediately; religious schools and monasteries were banned and destroyed on pain of death, and the monks and students themselves were shot. The province itself was renamed Xizang and stripped of any autonomy, and the Tibetan language was recognized as a dialect of Chinese and was violently banned and replaced with simplified Chinese. Ultimately, such measures helped shape an increasingly monolithic Chinese nation.\r\nThe Uнghur issue was extremely difficult to resolve. First things first, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was renamed the Xinjiang Uygur Region, removing all autonomy, and all schools were forcibly transferred to teaching in Chinese. Also, within a few years, all state and party bodies and the media switched to Chinese, and a mandatory subject of Chinese history and Chinese philosophy was added to the entrance and final exams. All this gave rise to a wide wave of popular discontent, the protesters tried to raise an uprising, the headquarters of which were mosques. Having suppressed the uprisings by military force, the Chinese leadership decided to move on to punitive measures: only central mosques with proven imams remained open, labor camps were opened, following the example of Stalin's Gulags, where everyone suspected of rebellion was sent, and wearing religious symbols and conducting religious rites in public places were banned, just as they banned all kinds of initiation of minors to religious rites. Such repressive policies help contain the Uyghur insurgency, but Sinicization is unlikely to come soon.\r\nMeritocracy\r\nNow that the old revolutionary leaders are gone and their reforms have not brought China to greatness, we can discard their failed experiments and move on to an entirely new model of statecraft based on a particular period of history. The first option is to restore factionalism in the party and allow certain factions to form and exist as long as they are all true to one idea - the idea of ​​Sun Yat-sen. The second option is to return the principles of Confucianism to state laws and to the formation of the state apparatus, thereby proclaiming the construction of a spiritually harmonious state. The third option is legalism, a strong centralized apparatus with harsh laws, a fanatical faith in China, and an economic orientation, not dogmatism. The last option is to establish a banal qualification for serving in the army - whoever served in the army to the rank of officer deserves to be elected and be elected, and perhaps it is this qualification that will bring great people to China?\r\nFactional Democracy with Term Limits\r\nConfucianism\r\nLegalism\r\nMilitary democracy\r\nThe orientation towards one-party democracy was confirmed by the legalization of the formation of various factional platforms within the party as long as they adhere to the ideas of Sun Yat-sen and do not oppose the constitutional order or support separatism. Let us hope that such transformations will rejuvenate the ranks of our party and bring in many new and useful ideas.\r\nFirst of all, in order to restore the principles of Confucianism in politics, it was necessary to cancel all decisions related to the fight against Confucius, and to restore all monuments, statues and texts related to the thousand-year history of Confucianism. Further, the attacks on Confucianism have been recognized as an excess by certain officials of the Chinese Communist Party, directed against the foundations of the Chinese nation. Then, the government officially introduced a document obliging all state and party employees to follow the ethics and principles of Confucius.\r\nAmong all the ways of reforming, the most difficult and long one was chosen - the return to legalism. The complete washing out of all ideologies (and their prohibition) and replacing them with the cult of the law, the total centralization of everything and the preparation of the population for truly cruel and unambiguous laws will take time before our new policy fully enters into force. And we will begin, of course, with strengthening the idea of complete and unquestioning obedience to the supreme ruler...\r\nWe announced to the whole country that great China needs great politicians, and who is greater than a patriotic officer who defends his fatherland, his fellow citizens, the entire heritage of our Chinese civilization? And we will begin the implementation of our great plan by the fact that now only military officers will be able to advance in a political career, and within five years everyone will either have to receive an officer's rank, having studied and served in the appropriate places, or leave politics. The great trial is coming!\r\nNew Meritocracy\r\nNo unusual ideas about the Chinese state apparatus were voiced.\r\nThe new one-party democracy directed its efforts not towards supporting democratic centralism, but towards factionalism. What difference does it make what kind of cat it is, if it catches mice, right? And there were several such cats, 4 of which are the largest at the moment: Tuanpai (a faction of Komsomol members), people from a higher Komsomol level who strive to renovate and reconstruct everything they touch; Taijidan (Red Princes), political families and heirs of the Chinese revolutionaries who are opponents of the past faction and strive for a pragmatic approach to everything; Tsinghua (university clique), natives of the elite Beijing University, members of this faction are the backbone of supporters of market reforms and the introduction of private property elements into the economy; and last but not least is Xinjun (new army), representing people from the military environment, these party members strive to protect and maintain a strong China by all means, in particular, paying great attention to the development of weapons. These factions, like many others, are now fighting for power within the party, and only the shift change system keeps the country from establishing a monolithic triumph of one faction over another, when every 10 years the country's leadership must be updated, and retired politicians have no right to return for a new term.\r\nLying on favorable historical ground, our reforms reached their peak: gradually more and more Confucian temples appeared in the country, and even in order to obtain a public position, it became necessary to pass an exam on knowledge of the basics of the concept of Confucianism. In all cities and areas of China, a new ethic has triumphed, which includes faith in the value of hard work, devotion to organization, frugality, self-giving, harmony in relationships, love of education and wisdom, and concern for social decency. The creation of social harmony has become not only a faith, but also the duty of every official and leader, the creation of harmony at the enterprise has become the duty of every director and administrator, and the creation of harmony in the family has become the duty of all its adult members at the legislative level. Often, harmony began to be understood as the principles of morality, justice, respect for elders, courage, fidelity, anti-radicalism and building a comprehensively developed person. European democrats cannot understand such a system and that is why they cannot find harmony in their home.\r\nIt took a long and difficult time, but in the end, the principles of legalism triumphed in our country. In the course of de-ideologization, any ideologies were excluded from the Constitution and all laws, instead of them absolute loyalty to the established system, the state and the elected leader was introduced. What kind of system was built in China? The new legalism began to rely on the complete equality of all before the law, which were absolutely severe and often included the death penalty, the veneration of all previous rulers, the absolute loyalty of citizens to the central government, the primacy of the economy over politics, the complete centralization of the state apparatus and the absolute unitarism of the state, and also the idea of ​​returning to China its former domination over all of Asia as the father of the peoples of this continent and the descendant of a great civilization. Naturally, the small peoples and some representatives of the old political system did not like this, but they were also dealt with: the uprisings were brutally suppressed by the army, the population was instilled with fear by extremely cruel and terrible punishments, every official had to be the first to be ready to go to the front line in case of war (thereby making it disadvantageous for officials to bring the situation to uprisings), and the peasant way of life was declared a model to be imitated in propaganda. New China has become a symbol for all extremely authoritarian movements in the world, but will such a system last after the death of the current ruler or will it be destroyed under own weight - only the future can tell.\r\nMany in the West began to call China the new Rome due to the fact that all our politicians are now only from the military officer corps, but in reality we had to make considerable efforts to reassure the people: in particular, anyone who simply served in the army is allowed to hold any public office of the lowest level, sergeants and non-commissioned officers are allowed to positions of middle level, and it is full officers who occupy higher positions. At the same time, in order to preserve the course for gender equality and not cause unrest and sabotage on the part of women, the gender criteria for the army were abolished in the country and, thereby, a women's military service was established. Thus, the country is now ruled by comrades who have gone through fire and water and real patriots of China, and let the whole world be afraid of us if it envy!\r\nOne country, two systems\r\nThere have been no changes here\r\nBecause we too often made deep contact with hostile states and pursued an unfriendly foreign policy, the Taiwanese government eventually, with the support of the West, canceled the agreements on the introduction of a new policy. We probably won't get another chance...\r\nThrough lengthy negotiations, we have successfully established a new relationship with Taiwan. \"One country, two systems\" for Taiwan is an extremely soft confederation: Taiwan adopts the Chinese yuan, but maintains a completely independent economic structure; the state announces the transfer of all diplomatic and foreign relations to Beijing, disbanding its diplomatic corps; at the same time, all foreign military bases are withdrawn from Taiwan, instead of which a limited Chinese contingent is introduced, but Taiwan retains its own army, its own air force and its own navy. This is a significant advance in relations between the two Chinas, and perhaps someday they will fully unite into one, but for now, all the Chinese are celebrating such a great victory!\r\nTaiwan is ours!\r\nOur adventurous and risky operation ended in complete success due to the complete weakening of the United States as a power and the enormous power of our great alliance - the Americans fled, taking with them everything of value that they managed, and we finally announced the complete reunification of our Motherland! On the site of the self-proclaimed Republic of China, the Taiwan Autonomous Region was formed due to the presence of local original peoples, and representatives of the old administration received various terms of imprisonment. High-ranking members of the Kuomintang and the leaders of the republic itself were sent to the tribunal, where they were charged with unleashing a civil war, numerous war crimes and betrayal of the motherland. Naturally, they all received capital punishment. And the day of reunification with Taiwan was declared a public holiday in honor of the complete unification of China. Glory!\r\nTriumph of anti-revisionism\r\nThe transition to the Chinese sphere of influence of Poland, Hungary and Romania, coupled with the victory of pro-Chinese forces in Iran and Afghanistan, dealt a significant blow to the influence of the Soviet Union in the socialist camp in general and in Eastern Europe in particular, and allowed China to firmly gain a foothold in the region. However, this was the end of the success - despite the serious efforts of the MGB, the Maoist forces in other countries of the Department of Internal Affairs failed to go beyond the borders of near-marginal circles and groups, and the exposure by the Soviet intelligence services of the conspiratorial organization Red Front, which was preparing the assassination of President Ligachev and the pro-Chinese coup d'état in the USSR (at least, so the Soviets themselves claim) led to a significant mobilization of the counterintelligence structures of the Internal Affairs Directorate and the pogrom of most of the more or less organized Maoist structures. Although the Maoists have succeeded in incorporating into the Bulgarian and Yugoslav Communist Parties, and there are some pro-Chinese elements among the non-party deputies in the USSR, this is clearly not enough to spread our influence in depth and breadth. Moreover, the Soviet Union, sensing a threat emanating from China, is tightening its internal policy and is increasingly trying to oppose our influence.\r\nThe transition to the Chinese sphere of influence of Poland, Hungary and Romania, coupled with the victory of pro-Chinese forces in Iran and Afghanistan, dealt a significant blow to the influence of the Soviet Union in the socialist camp in general and in Eastern Europe in particular, and allowed China to firmly gain a foothold in the region. The presence of a powerful base in Europe allowed the MGB to actively intervene in the processes accompanying the collapse of the USSR - taking advantage of the chaos, the pro-Chinese forces seized the initiative in the civil war in Tajikistan and seized power there, as a result of the uprising in Zhanaozen, Nursultan Nazarbayev was overthrown, and the new government of Kazakhstan allowed deployment of a Chinese military base in the republic. After Yeltsin's defeat in the 1996 presidential election and the anti-corruption campaign against the \"seven bankers\", a new stage in the development of Chinese-Russian relations began, in 1998 the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed, which settled the main controversial issues. At the same time, under pressure from our leadership, the CPRF united with the RCWP and «Labor Russia» into the Russian United Labor Front, whose program contains the provisions of \"Stalin's 10 blows\", Socialism of the 21st century and even Maoism. China's help allowed Gennady Zyuganov to stop the process of further decentralization of the CIS and «reboot» the Commonwealth, starting in the 00s the restoration of a common economic space and its integration with our economic alliance, in which Belarus and Ukraine play a significant role, also increasing contacts with China. In turn, Russia also became the initiator of the «16+1 Format», which is viewed by analysts as a tool for consolidating Chinese influence in Eastern Europe and its penetration into Western Europe. Who knows how far this will go...\r\nThe Maoist underground in the countries of the Eastern Bloc was finally marginalized.\r\nReturn to socialism\r\nAfter the rhetoric, theses and arguments of Wang Ming were used in the elimination of the Personality Cult of Mao, a wing appeared in the party who wanted his rehabilitation and restoration. Along with the havoc caused by de-maoization and the problems it revealed, this wing not only grew stronger, but also came up with the idea of ​​bringing to power the ideological heirs of Wang Ming and «pure Marxism-Leninism». On the one hand, this was intended to re-legitimize the Communist Party, on the other hand, to use the heirs of Wang Ming, who had no influence in China, as obedient puppets in the cause of the reign of the renewed Marxist-Leninists. Such ideas soon grew into a coup d'état, where, after the rehabilitation of the Wang Ming family and their return to China, along with the presentation of party cards, during a visit by the Chinese leader to a foreign state, an emergency congress was convened and the leader was dismissed for voluntarism and hiding his own participation in deeds in Mao's time. Now the Congress is faced with the choice of who should be declared the new - albeit partially formal - leader of the country: Meng Qingshu, Wang Ming's wife, a revolutionary, CCP activist who worked in the Women's Committee and the Child Care Association until 1956; or Wang Danzhi, the eldest son of Wang Ming, Ph.D. in physics and mathematics, a specialist in Chinese history and language and an active participant in the work on Wang Ming's books in 1969-1974. The rest of Wang Ming's children are either too young or did not work in politics at all. Congress will decide.\r\nMeng Qingshu - old revolutionary\r\nWang Danzhi - Wang Ming's faithful heir\r\nUpon the arrival of the now former leader, the Congress ended, the leader himself was already dismissed on an honorary pension, like many other dissenters. Wang Ming's course has triumphed, and only time will tell if his relatives who have arrived can keep his original ideas or if the party uses them as puppets to realize their own dreams.\r\nThe road will be mastered by the walking\r\nAfter a series of government resignations and the resulting political chaos, the standard of living in India began to fall, which together caused great unrest among the population and gave rise to the growth of communist forces of various persuasions. This is our chance to take power in India with friendly forces, but not everything is so simple: two communist associations are fighting for future power in the country. The first is a coalition of the United Front, which includes the moderate Maoist CPI (Marxist), the pro-Soviet CPI (from which the previous one broke away), local left-wing autonomist parties and the Muslim minority party. They understand that India is not yet ready for socialism, and are going to eliminate the caste system and tribalism in the first place, and also advocate wide autonomy, preferring to rely on urban residents. We can use their strength and, having agreed with the trade unions, arrange a mass strike, and then - relying on the military - carry out a coup. Another force is the disparate groups of Naxalites, the remnants of the СPI (Marxist-Leninist), which had previously broken away from the СPI(m). Among them, the three most powerful groups stand out - \"Liberation\", Naxalites who have switched to legal struggle, the so-called. the \"Mass Line\", supporters of a transitional socialist peasant state, and the CPI (Maoist), advocating an immediate revolution. If we make the necessary efforts, we can create a temporary alliance of the last three with one goal - to commit peasant guerrillas throughout the country. However, if we abandoned the theory of social-imperialism and allied ourselves with the revisionists from the USSR against the common enemy of world imperialism, then with enough influence, we could convince all communist forces to divide the sphere of influence in India and work together there, where they are most needed...\r\nBet on the United Front (СPI(m), СPI and small parties)\r\nBy all means unite the СPI (m-l) around the \"Mass Line\"\r\nSocialism in the city, capitalism in the countryside\r\nChina in CMEA, Army Strength > 25.0, Chinese Influence > 35.0\r\nThe difficult political and economic situation in the country led to the expansion of the popularity of the United Front, which, with our support, entered into an alliance with many trade unions and organized numerous strikes, which led to the resignation of the government. In the resulting vacuum, the armed wing of the United Front, along with ordinary workers, took control of the administrative centers of cities, announced the formation of an interim government from the United Front coalition, and, with the support of Generals Om Prakash Malhotra, Arun Sridhar Vaidya, Srinivasa Kumarah Singh Krishnaswami Sundarji, pulled over the entire army to your side. With the support of the army, the persecution of dissenters, the closure of opposition parties and preparations for socialist reforms began. However, the reforms did not have time to begin, as the Naxalite underground, united by the fact of the coup, declared the new government to be revisionist usurpers, puppets of the revisionists from the USSR and China, who had betrayed the cause of Mao, and began a guerrilla war against the new government. Right-wing rebels also crossed into the ranks of the partisans, having entered into an unspoken agreement with the Naxalites for the sake of a common cause. We need to save India!\r\nThe difficult political and economic situation in the country led to the expansion of the popularity of the Naxalites, who, seeing an opportunity, in some century decided not to split, but to unite to take power around the \"centrist\" group of the \"mass line\". Naturally, this association will be such only until the power of the Naxalites in India is consolidated, but until then we can count on their power in the implementation of our plan. However, on paper, it looked successful: the united Naxalites raised uprisings in many Indian provinces, relying on the peasantry and backward distant tribes, announcing the seizure of power in these regions, to which the government tried to respond by suppressing self-capture by military forces. The Naxalites, who calculated to propagandize the military and send broad peasant-tribal masses to the cities, miscalculated: somewhere the masses achieved success and defeated the soldiers, and somewhere the military suppressed the rebels. A widespread civil war broke out all over India. There is nowhere else to retreat!\r\nThe difficult political and economic situation in the country led to the expansion of the popularity of the communists throughout India, which, with the mediation of China and the approval of the USSR, united in a renewed National Salvation Front. Of course, the most radical of the Naxalites branded us as traitors to the common cause, but these small groups did not play a special political role, and the united Front organized mass strikes of the discontented, which led to the resignation of both the government and local rulers, and re-elections. In fact, taking full control of most polling stations, promising autonomy and rights to Muslims, and pogroms opposition parties with impunity, because the army refused to suppress such large-scale protests, the Front was successful in the elections and received about 40% of the seats in parliament. The FNS then entered into a coalition with the INC(S), formerly the INC(U), a socialist breakaway from the main INC, as well as smaller parties on the left, forming a stable coalition to pass laws and change the Constitution. \r\nIndian Civil War\r\nUnited front\r\nNationalists,{0}Naxalites\r\nJanata,{0}INK, СPI\r\nNaxalites\r\nNew India\r\nNo changes have shaken India so much that something has changed radically in it.\r\nA long civil war plunged an already affected and fragmented country into final famine, chaos and collapse. As a result, the resources of all the warring parties were extremely depleted, and dissatisfied people were already raising their heads inside. All this led to the conclusion of a truce between the parties and the division of India into three parts: in the most urbanized area, the Indian Republic was established, a bourgeois-democratic state prohibiting any radicalism, in which three major parties settled - the social democratic INC, the centrist Janata Dal and the right BJP; in the Muslim regions, the Islamic Republic of India was formed, where a democratic Muslim regime was established, trying to maintain moderate positions in everything; and in the most peasant and remote areas, Democratic India was founded, the regime of the most radical Naxalites, which declared the PRC a revision and traitors, completely isolated itself from everyone and formed a penniless economy of eternal war communism (and also sheltered Pol Potists and the Burmese socialist opposition). How long such a peace will last is unknown, but the parties are already gathering strength.\r\nA long civil war exhausted the population and undermined the Indian economy, and the new victorious government from the face of the United Front had to improve the situation in the ruined country. First of all, the United Front established the UF monopoly on political power, introduced a state of emergency and engaged in land reform: the lands were honestly redistributed among the peasants, and the peasants were obliged to voluntarily-compulsorily unite in cooperatives or family contracts, handing over a certain percentage of the crop to the state at the state price, and the rest by selling freely in the peasant markets which the state has opened throughout the country, thereby protecting India from famine, leading the peasants to the building of socialism, and, in doing so, without harming the patience and position of the peasantry. Caste distinctions were completely abolished, and an attempt to follow or belittle them on a caste basis is now threatened with criminal punishment, along with this, the Muslim regions received long-awaited autonomy, and the state engaged in extensive programs for education, the spread of hygiene and the creation of many medical centers throughout the country. In the cities, the state took control of all large-scale industry, allowing small and medium-sized enterprises to operate, but firmly establishing an external monopoly on trade, entrusting international trade and the management of state enterprises to the newly formed planning committee. India is gradually recovering, and who knows, maybe soon such a major power with so many resources and population will be able to become a new socialist power?\r\nA long civil war exhausted the population and undermined the economy of India and the new government in the person of the Coalition Government of Democratic India, which included the most radical Naxalites, right-wing nationalists and right-wing conservatives, had to not only deal with this issue, but also not be torn between each other. Under the terms of the formation of a single government, all paramilitary units were disbanded, which did not prevent the Naxalites from seizing control over a certain part of the peasant areas and organizing local self-government there. These Naxalites accused the old communists of revision and hanged them, just as they accused China of revision, breaking off relations with it and creating a refuge for the Polpotites and the Burmese socialist opposition. Such arbitrariness did not find support among the rest of the coalition government and, after an agreement could not be reached between them and the Naxalites, with the support of NATO, under the guise of holding elections, the right side of the coalition invited the leaders of the Naxalites to the capital, where they arrested them, and then brought down the army against peasant communes, thereby organizing a military operation «to suppress the separatists». During the war, which lasted several years, the Naxalites were finally defeated and fled to the mountains, and a pro-American military junta was actually established in India.\r\nA long civil war exhausted the population and undermined the economy of India and the new government, represented by the Interim Government for the Reconstruction of India, which included the BJP (Janata), the INC and the Communist Party (original), introduced a state of emergency to restore the country for a period of 5 years. First of all, the new government held show trials of the Naxalites, then conducted military raids on the villages: all families of Naxalite supporters were struck in political rights for 10 years, and then a law was introduced to equate any assistance to Naxalites with terrorism. Then a land reform was carried out: all the land was honestly redistributed among the peasants, who were herded into collective farms and forced to hand over all the products to the state at the state price, appointing retired military men to head the collective farms. Thus, the new government of India both solved the problem with finances (replenishing gold and foreign exchange reserves and the country's budget at the expense of collective farms), and took control of the entire peasant part of the country. In the cities, on the contrary, the new government abolished the monopoly on foreign trade, and also provided significant support to all types of businesses, incl. tax holidays and subsidies (and even privatized unprofitable enterprises), and expanded the package of social benefits for workers, thus stimulating the rapid recovery of the industry. After five years of reconstruction, the first elections were held, where it turned out that three leading forces had established themselves in the country: the entire left-wing electorate began to vote for the KPI, which began to constantly gain about 15% of the vote, becoming a permanent third, and the INC, which became centrist, alternately fought for the first place , and the BJP, a social conservative party, and each time the winner of the two received approximately 40% of the vote and entered into a coalition with the CPI, thereby maintaining a harmonious government, both left and right at the same time.\r\nA long civil war exhausted the population and undermined the economy of India and the new government of the victors from the face of the Naxalite coalition had to face many problems, ideas for solving which were significantly divided: while everyone agreed to conduct an honest redistribution of land, but on the peasant issue \"Liberation\" and \"Mass Line\" \"were in favor of private peasant farms, because. \"India was not yet ready for socialism\", while the CPI (Maoist) advocated the creation of communes of the type of Mao's times; at the same time, opinions were also divided on the political issue - the Mass Line and the CPI (Maoist) advocated the prohibition of all other parties and the unification of all Naxalist forces into a single one, while the Liberation demanded the establishment of democracy for all leftist forces and free elections. With our intervention, such quarrels led to a compromise, which, however, did not please anyone: the general elections were implemented, but only the Naxalist groups, which remained independent, were allowed to take part in them; distribution was made, but India was divided into regions, in each of which each of the three leading Maoist groups organized their land experiment with peasant reform to determine the best. Such an approach temporarily cooled the tension in the country, but certainly did not suit anyone. The political struggle between these three forces will continue, they will gradually increase their power, and one can only hope that this confrontation does not result in a new civil war.\r\nThe coalition government of the National Salvation Front, consisting of the CPI, moderate Maoists, moderate Naxalites, Muslims, regional socialist parties, and the INC (s), with the support of the army, approved a state of emergency in the country amid right-wing unrest. The unrest was suppressed, and the government began to reorganize the Constitution: the country was declared a socialist state, reactionary ideologies were banned as terrorist, all castes were abolished, and left-wing democracy was constitutionally established in the country - the bourgeois parliament was replaced by direct democracy of the soviets, where only parties were admitted socialist orientation. At the same time, any popular dissatisfaction with the new system was dispelled by a fair redistribution of land and the formation of new private farming throughout India, which, however, had to hand over part of the crop to the state at a state price; along with this, large enterprises were nationalized, and a state monopoly was established on foreign trade, while small and medium-sized businesses were allowed, subject to a progressive tax, in order to prevent the formation of large private business. The rights of the states were significantly expanded, the federalization of India expanded, Muslims and national minorities received their autonomy, which led to the creation of a decentralized economy and satisfied the masses, and the Indian states were divided into various \"belts\" of the СPI-СPI (m) electorate, moderate Naxalites and INC (s). However, none of the Federal Tax Service calls the current situation permanent and declares its \"temporality\", its \"transitivity\". True, no one knows how long the transition will last and what actions will be taken for the onset of socialism, but so far the Indian economy gives a stable growth in industry and living standards, however, the formation of Indian kulaks according to the old Soviet model is also beginning.\r\nLeft radicals\r\nConservatives\r\nModerate\r\nReformers\r\nLiberals\r\nthe war ended with the victory of the side\r\nWe are in alliances\r\nInfluence of China AND (+ Influence of the USSR, if we are in the same alliance)\r\nWill add Naxalite power in India\r\nChina: Wang Ming's Legacy\r\nThank you for your purchase!\r\nAfter the return of the Wang Ming family to China to high-ranking positions, the seizure of Mao's works and related books began throughout the country, Mao's works were not only seized from schools, libraries, exhibitions, but were also prohibited from storage. At the same time, books authored by Wang Ming were included in the program of Chinese history in the 1930s-1960s, separate lessons began to be given to the \"struggle of the valiant communist Wang Ming against the Mao clique\", and the identification of the Mao Zedong regime with feudal socialism was firmly included in the political theory of Marxism-Leninism PRC and in the textbook of the History of the Communist Party of China. The country has entered a new era of \"correcting socialism\" and \"restoring the correct course of the party\". Raise the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Ming! Forward to the victory of communism!\r\nBrazil has long been ruled by a military junta that maintains the appearance of democracy, the so-called. a \"controlled democracy\" that sees elections consistently won by ARENA, a conservative Brazilian political party created to provide political support for a military dictatorship. The current president of the country is Ernesto Geisel, who belongs to the moderate line of the armed forces, since he perceived the military regime launched in 1964 as a transitional regime to ensure liberalism in the country. Under the reign of Geisel, a gradual transition to liberal democracy began, the weakening of censorship and the reduction of repression (along with increased control over the courts and over governors by the state). However, he is not running for a second term, and the growing opposition could win the upcoming elections. There are currently two candidates: Joao Figueiredo, from ARENA, and Euler Bentes Monteiro, from MDB. João, a representative of the ruling group, intends to continue Geisel's work of gradually democratizing the regime under the control of the military, liberalizing the country's economy and fighting the communist insurgency. On the other hand, Euler, who did not support the 1964 coup, is striving for a rapid liberalization of the regime and the establishment of free courts, being a representative of the opposition MDB, speaking from opposition positions: the restoration of democracy, freedom of speech, social guarantees and the legalization of the trade union movement. Despite Geisel's machinations, the opposition still has a chance to secure enough votes in the Electoral College.\r\nHappy Rio\r\nJoao Figueiredo, ARENA (Right Dictatorship)\r\nEuler Bentes Monteiro, MDB (Centrism)\r\nKeep out\r\nHaving won, Joao promised «an outstretched hand of reconciliation», vowed to make «this country a democracy». And the first thing he did, under the pressure of massive trade union strikes organized by the opposition from the MDB, was to announce a broad general and unlimited amnesty for politicians, which allowed those who had been exiled by the military regime to return to Brazil. Shortly thereafter, he initiated electoral reform to end the two-party system, resulting in the formation of four opposition parties to the ruling regime. At the same time, the current legislation prohibited party coalitions and required \"equal voting\" (a voter could only vote for candidates from one party). As president, he also addressed the United Nations General Assembly, criticizing the high interest rates charged by developed countries, and also introduced an agricultural stimulus program. Many small farmers have gone bankrupt due to incentives to modernize Brazilian agriculture. Agriculture, however, was indeed modernized.\r\nIn order to form a political majority in the parliament, the MDB and personally Euler had to negotiate with the moderate part of ARENA, as a result of which the reform package was cut off and significantly reduced, in particular, parts of the growth of social spending, an increase in the minimum wage, pensions and benefits were eliminated. The final package of reforms was called the manifesto \"In Defense of the Nation\", and the playwright and writer Ariano Suassuna (responsible for bills on funding, development and freedom of national art and creativity, including the abolition of censorship), lawyer and historian Barbosa participated in its writing Lima Sobrinho (who introduced \"for the protection of national security\" clauses prohibiting the privatization of state-owned companies and a ban on the re-election of persons in leadership positions), as well as sociologist and politician Fernando Enrique Cardoso (who lobbied for a project to combat political radicalization and radicals, as well as about a company for teaching the masses political literacy so that they do not fall under the influence of radicals). Along with this, as a compromise, amnesties were granted to all Brazilians sent into exile and to all those who did not participate in the violence. Thus passed the mass amnesty of the political opposition, which finally led to the complete fall of the two-party regime. At the same time, the reform package also included a bill that provides immunity to all figures, participants and supporters of the old government and, in particular, members of the ARENA party, guaranteeing a ban on any condemnation or prosecution of everything that has been happening since the 1964 coup.\r\nThe new government did not want to be friends with us.\r\nThe new government is determined to be friends with us.\r\nBrazil renewal\r\nBy now, the existing two-party system has been eliminated. PMDB was created as the successor to MDB and PDS as the successor to ARENA. Between 1980 and 1981, the most reactionary factions in the military engaged in terrorism and carried out a series of bombings and kidnappings. At that time, the military command blamed the attack on left-wing radicals. However, this hypothesis did not find the support of the population (the left-wing partisan detachments had completely died out by 1974). A few months before this presidential election, civil rallies called Diretas Já swept across the country, demanding direct elections in 1985, but this proposal did not find support in Parliament. In this regard, the opposition parties have united around Tancredo Neves, the PMDB candidate, who is making proposals for the final liberalization of the political and economic systems of Brazil. At the same time, the PDS, which has a parliamentary majority, has split, and the remaining structure is oscillating between the nomination of two candidates - Paulo Maluf and Mario Andreazza. The latter is known for his excellent work on the rapid and high-quality development of infrastructure and the Brazilian merchant fleet, the development of the housing complex and the environmental program. In contrast, Paulo is a more conservative candidate, during his career he often worked in the financial and economic sphere, is responsible for a sharp reduction in the bureaucracy of the financial and tax systems, the widespread distribution of primary and secondary education schools, the creation of recreation areas and the fight against unsanitary conditions. If Paulo wins, democratization will continue, while under Mario the focus will be on the economy. At the same time, left-wing parties can also take advantage of the resulting confusion and splits, if they manage to unite in a coalition...\r\nTancredo Neves, PMDB (Right Dictatorship)\r\nPaulo Maluf, PDS (Red Toryism)\r\nMario Andreazza, PDS (Liberalism)\r\nLeonel Brizola, PDT-PTB-PT (Democratic Socialism)\r\nImmediately after the inauguration of Tancredo Neves died, and the country was headed by Vice President José Sarney, a former member of the MDB who went over to the opposition. In his reforms, he approved the final return of Brazil to democracy, completely abolishing censorship and restoring the direct election of the President. Freedom of speech was given to the press, trade unions, and the Constituent Assembly was convened. Among other things, more than a thousand concessions for public radio and television were distributed, mainly on a commercial basis and without bidding, which meant the \"privatization\" of television and radio broadcasting, the \"privatization\" of the media into the hands of private monopolists. At the same time, José Sarney renewed the idea of ​​an independent foreign policy by opening a dialogue with the countries of Latin America, including socialist Cuba, with which relations were severed during the 1964 coup. Engaged in agrarian reform, environmental programs and further reduction of bureaucracy. However, the main danger during his reign was rampant inflation, which none of his plans could stop. \r\nDue to the high stability in the state, the split within the PDS was minimal, therefore, after the party electors elected Maluf instead of Andreazza as their candidate, the more liberal part of the party did not dare to leave the PDS, having made a compromise. In exchange for the refusal to introduce direct presidential elections, direct elections of governors were introduced (the opposition wanted both). Next, Paulo took up economic issues: in order to overcome inflation and support business, it was decided to start large infrastructure and industrial projects through government orders, which were allocated to private companies in exchange for reinvesting profits in the Brazilian economy. The era of huge projects that ended 10 years ago has resumed, with a dramatic increase in the number of bridges, roads, schools, hospitals, power plants and ports. The development of education, medicine and the electric power industry began at a rapid pace. Such reforms were able to raise the purchasing power of the population, due to which inflation was temporarily stopped. At the same time, Brazil's political field continues to grow with the growth of new parties and movements. Despite all attempts by the PDS to preserve the political legacy of the \"Revolution of 1964\", the days of apoliticality and bipartisanship are finally over.\r\nAfter the moderate and liberal wing threatened to secede from the PDS and form a coalition with the opposition from the PMDB, Paulo Maluf withdrew his candidacy and the PDS supported Mario Andreazza, which allowed him to win over part of the electorate from the opposition of the PMDB. Despite this, Paulo Maluf was nominated as vice president to consolidate the entire party. As part of the political reforms, in order to seize the baton from the opposition, the new government introduced direct presidential elections and direct elections of governors, thus becoming the first party to implement this. The popularity of such a move allowed the authorities to circumvent the requirement to convene a new Constituent Assembly, retaining the parliamentary majority. In the economy, the start of the New Economic Plan was announced: it was announced the privatization of all unprofitable state-owned enterprises and the implementation of a huge housing program and an environmental program at the expense of the funds received from privatization. By providing the entire population with their own housing, the government was able to significantly reduce further government spending (largely by ending subsidies to many state-owned enterprises) and thereby stop the inflation that threatened to kill the Brazilian economy.\r\nSocial instability, growing tension and uncertainty about the future finally undermined the positions of the right-wing parties. Entering the coalition, despite their differences, the three parties on the left ran a single candidate (Partido Democrático Trabalhista, orthodox Labor; Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro, a left-wing authoritarian group close to the military; and Partido dos Trabalhadores, democratic socialists close to the trade union movement). Along with this, the split of the PDS led to the fact that the centrist movement that emerged from them decided to support the candidate from the left, who promised to preserve and deepen democratization and federalization. Having come to power, the coalition of the left, without having a majority in parliament, had to create tactical alliances: political reforms were accepted in compromise with the centrists, and economic reforms in compromise with the SDP. As a result, the direct election of the president and the direct election of governors were introduced, all censorship was abolished, however, the privatization of television, radio and media did not happen. In the economy, the reforms consisted of the forcible purchase of 51% of the shares of oil and gas companies and all landed property where natural resources were located (this was called \"nationalization\"). On the budget profit received, what was later nicknamed \"Brizolismo\" began - a reliance on the poor, disadvantaged and marginalized part of the population: the widespread construction of social housing, the creation of jobs through the organization of state orders (state orders were created for the sake of creating jobs, and not out of economic expediency), the introduction of a food basket (which the poor could receive through coupons, and the cost was paid by the state) and other social projects that would later be taken over by the government of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.\r\nThird way\r\nEconomic difficulties prompted the government in the spring of 1975 to adopt a tough anti-inflationary program. The jump in prices and the freezing of salaries provoked mass protests in Buenos Aires. In the same year, the country was divided into five military zones, each commander of which was given full autonomy in unleashing a carefully planned wave of repression. A number of revolutionary organizations - incl. The Montoneros, a group of far-left Peronists, and the AAA death squads under José López Reg, stepped up their efforts to escalate political violence (including kidnappings and bombings) against the backdrop of harsh repressive and punitive measures by the army and police. Soon, President Isabel Peron was detained, all television and radio stations were taken under the control of the military. Regular transmissions to them were stopped, after which the first official message was released, which reported that the power in the country was under the control of the military, as well as the need for citizens to strictly comply with the requirements of the military, police and security forces. The appeal was signed by General Jorge Rafael Videla, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera and Brigadier General Orlando Ramon Agosti. The following morning passed without any high-profile incidents, no one resisted the coup, but the putschists decided to start detaining workers, students, political and trade union activists. Abductions of all opposition representatives from their homes, places of work or on the street have begun. Resistance to the military is fragmented, however, with a good leadership group, it would be possible to rally liberal, centrist and left parties, as well as Peronist left groups and trade union organizations, with each other in order to create an organized resistance to the putschists.\r\nEstablish trade ties with the new government (nothing will change)\r\nTry to rally all opposition forces against the military (the political system will change)\r\nThe regime in Argentina took control of the legislature and suppressed both freedom of the media and freedom of speech by imposing severe censorship. The period between 1976 and 1983 is also known as the Dirty War years. The intensified rebels of the «left» wing tried to counteract the military junta. Opposition to the government was suppressed with the use of «death squadrons», as a result of which 10 to 30 thousand citizens, real or imaginary oppositionists, disappeared without a trace (Operation Condor), including children were taken from their parents before the latter were killed. The junta appointed José Alfredo Martínez de Osa to the post of Minister of Economy, who began to pursue a policy of stabilization and privatization of state-owned companies, which later became known as the neo-liberal course. Martínez de Hos was opposed by General Ramon Diaz, the Minister of Planning, who advocated a policy of corporatism with state control over key industries. The latter was soon retired. Social stratification was expanding.\r\nWith the support of our intelligence networks, we were able to rally all the trade union, democratic and left forces around the Peronist guerrillas and organize a single underground center in the jungle. The Coordinating Council of the opposition was not only able, with broad popular support, to save and protect many from illegal arrests, but also to organize strikes throughout the country, which completely stopped all production. In the conditions of fierce resistance within the junta, a coup took place: Roberto Eduardo Viola, with the support of Ramon Diaz, Orlando Ramon Agosti and a number of generals, arrested the leader of the junta Jorge Rafael Videla, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Masser and a number of their ardent associates, after which he announced an amnesty and entered into negotiations with the opposition within the framework of the round table. During the negotiations, a compromise was reached - the military abandoned the ban and persecution of trade unions and political parties, taking upon themselves the provision of order and stability in the country for an indefinite \"period until the end of the crisis\", thereby assuming the authority to Appoint the President, form the Cabinet of Ministers and set dates holding parliamentary elections. Despite the protests of the Peronist left, the democratic, left and trade union forces agreed to such an agreement, and the Peronist left had no choice but to agree to the demands for disarmament and the transition to peaceful actions, so as not to escalate the situation, but in response they demanded arrest and persecution AAA organizations and their chief Jose Lopez Rega himself, and the junta agreed to this. In Argentina, peace and order were restored, repression was stopped, and the Ministry of Economy was headed by General Ramon Diaz, who began the implementation of a policy of corporatism while maintaining state control over key industries. But the junta is well aware that their rule is not eternal, but will drag on to the last...\r\nWe can't take it anymore\r\nInheriting an economy struggling with huge interest rates, the new Central Bank president reversed those policies, starting a move towards economic liberalization that was complemented by the restoration of the right to assembly and freedom of expression. This was done as a result of the enormous pressure exerted by the large number of political parties that came together in a coalition in 1981. Six years of intermittent wage freezes, anti-industry policies and restrictive measures have left GDP per capita at its lowest level since 1968 and real wages at around 40%. Demonstrations demanding elections were swift, and a protest in the Plaza de Mayo was violently suppressed by the police on December 16, 1982, ending in the death of a demonstrator and the junta's hopes that the elections would be postponed indefinitely. The regime began to prepare for a democratic transition by destroying evidence of the disappearance of some 30,000 dissidents. However, in February 1983, Buenos Aires Police Chief Ramon Camps publicly acknowledged the crimes and stated that \"the disappeared were in fact dead.\" Camps' interview, which caused widespread outrage, forced the junta to issue a new law for political parties: most restrictions were lifted, human rights were restored. The new elections are being held under a 1957 constitutional text imposed during the military dictatorship that called itself the \"Liberation Revolution\", which established indirect suffrage and a six-year presidential term without the possibility of immediate re-election. The main participants are the social democratic CRU, the centrist Peronist JP, and the trade union-syndicalist NP. At the same time, Montoneros, the extreme leftist Peronists, who created the legal APP party, are trying to get into the elections.\r\nRaul Alfonsin, Civic Radical Union (Social Democracy)\r\nItalo Luder, Justicialist Party (centrism)\r\nOscar Allende, Implacable Party (democratic socialism)\r\nMario Firmenich, Authentic Peronist Party (state socialism)\r\nFar-left Peronists wiped out\r\nAlfonsín started his government with the slogan \"with democracy you eat, heal and educate\". R. Alfonsin's presidency was accompanied by high inflation rates, a significant increase in public debt, workers' strikes and military discontent. As a result of a sharp increase in budget spending and money emission, in the last year of his reign, the Argentine economy was in a deep crisis, accompanied by high inflation and currency devaluation. His economic policy was marked by a very high external debt that led to a default in 1988, high inflation that turned into hyperinflation, and a sluggish economy whose GDP fell from $103 billion to $76 billion. As a result, there was a large privatization of state-owned companies. Along with this, the government did not allow collective bargaining on wages and approved a ban on the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the Peronist trade union organization, facing strong conflict with the unions. R. Alfonsin, who was an active defender of human rights, contributed to the legal prosecution of members of the military junta. During his reign, both ordinary officers and some high-ranking officials were convicted and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. He was also one of the founders of the Delhi Six, the leaders of countries that advocated nuclear disarmament and detente in the world. Laws were introduced to protect human rights, protect property, and protect national minorities and Native Americans. In general, his period of government was characterized by attempts to combine social reforms with privatization and combine the introduction of legal democracy with the persecution of the largest trade union movement.\r\nLuder always had a temperate attitude that earned him respect in the political world both inside and outside his party, and also maintained a fluid relationship with the military. Prior to the 1976 coup, he stood as a possible candidate to replace President Maria Isabeli de Perón. In the elections, Luder relied on the slogan of the creation of a \"state of law\" and on the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), as well as on the idea of ​​a \"pact\" between all classes, with the domination and leading role of the state in politics and the economy. Leaders lauded the figure of Isabelle Peron, who was \"widely underestimated and whose absence from the country was evident\". After winning more power, Luder began the process of reorganizing the Peronist movement, declaring that “Peronism has been thrown overboard and replaced by a party bureaucracy; we forgot about the front with our historical allies in order to seek support in elections against nature; elected positions of the highest ranks were appropriated by fraud and violence. After a series of mass resignations and purges of the party, organizational reforms began in the form of the establishment of a corporate state: the approval of the CGT by the state trade union, the mandatory membership in the CGT of workers and their bosses, the formation of semi-state corporations, which, under the control of the Ministry of Planning, were to become the flagships of various sectors of the economy, receiving state support and preferences. The former associates of far-right Peronism, José López Rega, were integrated into the administration of the ministries.\r\nAlende has always been anti-Peronist and anti-Marxist, striving with all his might to support the ban on Peronism and to keep Marxists out of leadership roles (although he collaborated with the communist parties from time to time against Peron's dictatorship). In 1972, he founded the Irreconcilable Party (IP) because the military government forbade the use of the old name. After the end of the national reorganization process in 1983, the Implacable Party ran again in the 1983 elections with Oscar Allende as presidential candidate and Lisandro Viale for vice president. Allende again decided to form the People's Revolutionary Union, which included the legal structure of Montoneros (APP), the Communist Party, the Union of the Argentine People, the Christian Democratic Party and smaller moderate left and centre-left parties. Having won against the backdrop of the country's complete decline and rising poverty, the shaky coalition first attacked the right-wing and centrist Peronists: the leaders of the Peronist trade union CGT were arrested for participating in the dictatorship of Isabela Peron and condoning the terrorist activities of the AAA, and the trade union itself was divided into several independent organizations on a territorial basis; all participants in the \"Dirty War\", incl. their leader, José López Rega, was wanted for countless murders; Luder and the leadership of the Justicialist Party were arrested for supporting and complicity in the tyranny and atrocities of the military junta regime (the former leaders of the military junta and the closest accomplices of their repression were also arrested), and the party itself was banned. At the same time, all state-owned enterprises were reorganized into industry conglomerates, many officials of state corporations were purged, and the bureaucratic apparatus that had swollen under the junta was reduced. Trade union activity began to be encouraged by the state, trade unions got the right to dictate working conditions, and without the consent of the trade union it was impossible to hire a person. As part of the campaign to combat inflation, a devaluation and an emergency replenishment of the gold reserves were carried out.\r\nIn 1983, the Montoneros influenced the left wing of the Peronist Intransigence and Mobilization movement and the Justicialist Party with a powerful campaign of posters on the streets and the publication of the newspaper La Voz, drawing over part of the members and electorate of moderate and centrist Peronists. The growth of popularity and strength of the PAP was also facilitated by multiple amnesties of left-wing political activists. By forming an electoral coalition with the Communist Party, leftist movements and seizing control of the Peronist General Confederation of Labor (CGT), Mario Firmenich was able to mobilize the broad masses and win the elections. Having come to power, counter-repressions were brought down on the leaders of the junta, participants in the right-Peronist AAA and the Dirty War, as well as on members of the government of Isabeli de Peron. Having cleared the political field of \"terrorists who killed or participated in the murder of many honest workers and activists\", the 1957 Constitution was declared invalid, instead a Constitutional Commission was convened, which included members of the APP coalition (and the APP itself), the Justicialist Party, as well as small organizations (not decisive, but showing the democratic essence of the new Constitution). Parliament began to be formed on a territorial basis of single-member constituencies (which allowed the Peronists through the CGT to get a majority of deputies), and a presidential republic was established in the country. In the economic sphere, the CGT was declared a state trade union, compulsory membership in the CGT of workers was introduced, all state enterprises were reorganized into industry conglomerates, many officials of state corporations were purged, and the bureaucracy that had bloated under the junta was reduced. The Ministry of Planning announced the launch of a plan to increase the industry and prosperity of Argentina.\r\nBolivia, my country, you are all on fire\r\nGeneral elections were held in Bolivia on 9 July 1978. Elections were held for the first time since 1966, when several military coups took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The main candidates are Juan Pereda, an air general and confidant of former dictator Hugo Banzer, supported in his presidential campaign by the Nationalist Union of the People and the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement of the People (social conservative nationalist parties); and Hernan Silas, nominated by the Democratic and Popular Unity Front, a coalition of left-nationalist, socialist and communist parties, is a strict democrat and social reformer. The rest of the candidates do not have a chance to get at least 50% of the votes, since in the Bolivian elections it takes just that many votes to win the elections, which is why the position of the first democratic elections is very precarious, but it is on them that there is an opportunity to pave the way for the future parliamentary majority.\r\nJuan Pereda, UNP (Right Dictatorship)\r\nHernán Siles, UDP (Right Dictatorship)\r\nAlthough Juan Pereda Asbun of the Nationalist Union won the presidential election, it was noted that more votes were cast than the number of registered voters (so much so that if they were recounted, Juan would not have received the Required 50% of the vote). After reviewing allegations of fraud and other irregularities, including voter census fraud, the theft of ballot boxes and bribes to finance Pereda Asbun's campaign, the Electoral Court ruled on July 20 to annul the results. The day after the election was annulled for fraud, Pereda became president in a military coup. On the same day, by presidential decree, a state of siege was introduced throughout Bolivia and all public meetings were banned, purges of the army, repressions, and persecution of trade unions began. All this, together with a decline in the economy and prosperity, led to mass unrest and rallies, and an attempt to extend his term of office finally led to a military counter-coup on November 24, after which General David Padilla became president. New elections were scheduled for July next year.\r\nDespite best efforts, none of the candidates managed to win 50% of the vote, since no candidate received an absolute majority of the valid votes, the Congress had to determine who would become the new President of the Republic. In accordance with the current Constitution, the three candidates who received the largest number of votes of citizens participated in the election race. After several rounds of voting, without obtaining an absolute majority among parliamentarians, Hugo Banser extended his term for one year and called new elections for July next year, and until then he guaranteed cooperation with the democratically elected parliament, thereby calming the democrats and the opposition, promising to finally leave in July 1979.\r\nAnd again, and again, and again\r\nTogether with the determination of a new date for the elections, it was announced that the Constitution of 1967 would be the Constitution in force for them, and the acceptance of the conditions established therein for participation as a candidate. The electoral formula system that was applied in the 1979 elections was a simple private or distribution system. The biggest innovation in voting in the 1979 electoral process was the introduction of a multi-color and multi-character ballot (DL. 16095). Previously, each political party had its own ballot paper, which opened up ample opportunities for manipulation. At the moment, the most popular candidates are: Hernán Siles Zuaso, from the Democratic and Popular Unity coalition, which includes various parties of the Bolivian left, and the candidate himself will adhere to the moderate democratic left; and Victor Paz Estenssoro, from the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement-Alliance, a right-wing nationalist conservative bloc. Victor himself was three times the President of Bolivia (not in a row) before the military coup, and earlier - the Minister of Finance, and adheres to liberal-conservative views. If none of the candidates gets 50% of the votes, then the parliament will choose the President, and his decision depends on what happened in the parliamentary elections last year.\r\nHernán Siles Zuazo, UDP (Social Democracy)\r\nVictor Paz Estenssoro, MNRA (centrism)\r\nThe result of the vote was a virtual draw between Hernan Siles and Victor Paz. Since no candidate received an absolute majority of valid votes, the Congress elected Hernán Siles as the new President of the Republic for a one-year term, under pressure from the military, setting the next elections to be held in June of the following year. The new government was formed from a shaky interim coalition of leftist, social liberal and centrist parties, with Lydia Geiler as head of government. The provisional government was forced to cooperate with the military in order to avoid a military coup, maintaining the funding of the army at the proper level and non-interference in the internal affairs of the generals. At the same time, a moderate liberalization of censorship, the arts and academia was launched, as well as the improvement of the protection of the labor rights of workers and women through the reorganization of the labor code and the introduction of social laws. But this shaky coalition is unlikely to last beyond the next election.\r\nThe result of the vote was a virtual draw between Hernan Siles and Victor Paz. Since no candidate received an absolute majority of valid votes, the Congress elected Victor Paz as the new President of the Republic for a one-year term, under pressure from the military, setting the next elections for June next year. The new government was formed from a shaky interim coalition of conservative, liberal, and centrist parties, with Lydia Geiler leading the government. The provisional government was forced to cooperate with the military in order to avoid a military coup, maintaining the funding of the army at the proper level and non-interference in the internal affairs of the generals. Along with this, a moderate liberalization of the economy was launched: reducing the bureaucracy, easing duties and barriers to business, amending the tax code, partially selling a small stake in state-owned enterprises and expanding their self-government. The path of reforms has been set.\r\nThe result of the vote was a virtual draw between Hernan Siles and Victor Paz. Since none of the candidates obtained an absolute majority of the valid votes, the Congress attempted to elect a new president of the republic, but after several ballots, without obtaining an absolute majority among parliamentarians, it was decided to transfer the post to the head of the House of Senators for a period of one year, who would be obliged to call new elections in 1980. Thus, Walter Guevara, the closest associate of Juan Pereda and the former military junta, was appointed president. However, his reign lasted only 3 months, when Colonel Natush Bush carried out a coup d'etat, accusing Walter Guevara of trying to usurp power. Despite the terror that Natush Bush unleashed on the streets, mass protests of people took place throughout Bolivia, then Natush said that \"he was deceived by unscrupulous politicians\" who guaranteed him that if he overthrew Walter, he would receive the support of political parties, which he did not happened. Having agreed to appoint Lydia Geiler as President, the failed putschist fled the country.\r\nGod loves trinity\r\nThe 1980 Bolivian presidential election took place on Sunday, June 29, 1980. Since no candidate received more than half of the votes, the National Congress had to choose a president from among the candidates with the most votes. In these elections, citizens had to cast a single vote for all positions: president, vice president, senators and deputies. The polling station count was not final; Departmental “computer tables” were created, which, although they could not change the results recorded in the protocols of the table, had the right to cancel them. The main confrontation in Congress is between Hernan Siles and Hugo Banzer Suarez, the old politician Victor Paz Estenssoro has not received a single vote. Hernan is still a representative of the left coalition, and if earlier this coalition successfully won the parliamentary elections, then he will be guaranteed victory in Congress. The other candidate, Hugo Banser, is from the Nationalist Democratic Action, a national conservative party, and the former dictator of Bolivia. He also has little chance of winning if the right-wing conservatives have not been able to win popular support before. The outcome is not clear.\r\nHernan Siles Zuaso, MNRI (democratic socialism)\r\nHugo Banser Suarez, ADN (proto-fascism)\r\nAfter coming to power, the fragile Bolivian democracy found itself in a very difficult social, economic and political situation. Economically, Bolivia was bankrupt. In addition, hyperinflation (27,000%) was unleashed, which destroyed the purchasing power of employees, leading the country to anarchy. This situation arose due to 18 years of successive coups and military violations. Fortunately, the great parliamentary support allowed Sailus to find answers to solve the situation, given that Sauilus was always against violence and was fundamentally ready to resort only to democratic methods of government. First of all, a temporary fixing of prices for essential goods was established, and in response to an attempt by trade unions to arrange mass rallies, the rights of trade unions were expanded, mandatory membership of workers in them was established and a ban on the creation of an employment contract without the participation of trade unions. Despite the attempts of the right-wing national conservatives to paralyze the adoption of laws, the new leadership carried out a denomination, increased the minimum wage, introduced a minimum food basket for the poor, and increased the number of government orders to create new jobs and develop infrastructure in the country. With the full support of the people, the fugitive Nazis were arrested, as well as the initiators, participants and accomplices of the previous military coup, including Hugo Banser, a purge took place in the army and, then, all parties and movements formed by accomplices of the coup or supporting the coup were banned, and she herself supporting any of the past military coups became a criminal offence. With the support of Congress, the people, and labor unions, Siles began to implement his plan to create a moderate socialist democracy.\r\nAfter coming to power, the fragile Bolivian democracy found itself in a very difficult social, economic and political situation. Economically, Bolivia was bankrupt. In addition, hyperinflation (27,000%) was unleashed, which destroyed the purchasing power of employees, leading the country to anarchy. This situation arose due to 18 years of successive coups and military violations. The solution to this situation was Banser's \"Moving Forward\" program, which consisted of two points: the fight against coca and privatization. The goal was to significantly reduce government spending (and hence inflation) and to eradicate the use of coca leaves for making coca paste and drug trafficking. This operation received the support of the United States government, which led to riots, strikes and marches, many of which were led by Evo Morales, the leader of the coca leaf unions. Suárez soon declared a state of siege to stop the wave of social protests against the privatization of the city's drinking water and sewage services in the so-called \"Water War\", which was later only intensified. Inflation slowed down, economic growth began, but all this took place in parallel with the impoverishment of the population and a sharp reduction in the rights of the indigenous peoples of America, just like with armed terror against their activists.\r\nOn July 17, 1980, a group of soldiers with close ties to drug trafficking, led by Luis Garcia Mesa, launched another bloody coup, overthrowing the democratic government and preventing Hernan's inauguration. The repression and corruption of the new regime led to a general strike and brought the country to the brink of civil war. The military dictatorship collapsed, and power passed to the National Congress, formed according to the composition of 1980, which decided to recognize the 1980 elections as valid and, accordingly, appoint Hernán Siles Suazo as president. After coming to power, the fragile Bolivian democracy found itself in a very difficult social, economic and political situation. Economically, Bolivia was bankrupt. In addition, hyperinflation (27,000%) was unleashed, which destroyed the purchasing power of employees, leading the country to anarchy. This situation arose due to 18 years of successive coups and military violations. Siles had no economic answers. Siles had great difficulty in controlling the situation, had almost no support from Congress. The opposition, led by trade union leader Juan Lechin, paralyzed the government with constant strikes. Price fixing failed due to pressure from the COB, private entrepreneurs, and right-wing and liberal political parties with majorities in Congress. However, Siles refused to take unconstitutional measures, believing that the democratic values ​​achieved were not worth any money. It should be noted in his government's favor that he managed to preserve and develop democracy in the country, placing Bolivia as the figurehead of the democratic restoration of the Southern Cone. Faced with the impossibility of a way out of the economic crisis and the political impasse, President Siles decided to start a hunger strike, but since this had no effect, the Catholic Church mediated the government's negotiations with all political parties with parliamentary representation to reach a compromise. Tired and disappointed, Hernan Siles Zuazo retired from politics.\r\nHelicopter tour\r\nIn September 1973, a military coup took place in Chile, as a result of which the government of socialist Salvador Allende was overthrown and a junta led by General Augusto Pinochet seized power. The new regime immediately curtailed the reforms begun by Allende and began mass repressions against its opponents, under which even the Christian Democratic Party, which contributed to the putsch, fell under. According to Chilean emigrants and foreign media, in the first days after the coup, 3,225 people were killed, another 37,000 were severely tortured. The elimination of social guarantees, the complete opening of the market for foreign corporations and the active implementation of neoliberal reforms led to the impoverishment of the majority of the country's population and the beginning of the consolidation of the opposition against the dictator. It is represented by two forces - the more right-wing Democratic Alliance (AD) led by the CDA and the Radical Party, and the more left-wing People's Democratic Movement (MDP) led by the pro-Soviet CPC and the Left Revolutionary Movement (MIR). These two blocks cooperate with each other, but the first stands for the peaceful removal of Pinochet from power by constitutional means, and the second for the violent overthrow of the junta. China was one of the first to recognize the Pinochet regime and even expelled the old Chilean ambassador (a member of the Christian Democratic Party) from the country, after which the entire Maoist opposition broke off contact with us. Therefore, if we want to intervene, then we will either have to look for a weak link in the Government Junta, or put up with AD and MDP.\r\nInfiltrate military structures under the guise of strengthening relations (nothing will change)\r\nStart restoring contacts with AD and MDP (proto-fascism)\r\nIt was not hidden from our diplomats and the military that between Pinochet and his closest supporter, the author of the coup plan and the commander-in-chief of the Chilean Air Force, General Gustavo Lee, contradictions are gradually growing. Lee, an open neo-fascist and corporatist, has a negative view of the neo-liberal reforms of the \"Chicago Boys\" and the increasingly obvious desire for self-rule by Pinochet. We convinced the general of the need for closer cooperation with the fascist organization \"Motherland and Freedom\" (PIL) Roberto Time and promised him public support in case they tried to expel him from the Government Junta. Active cooperation between the PLA and the Chilean Armed Forces allowed us to recruit many mid-level officers and even some of the generals, thanks to which we learned about the plans of the dictator in time. At a meeting of the Government Junta, where Pinochet was going to remove Lee, he refused to resign and turned to us and his supporters for help. PIL militants blocked the garrisons in Santiago, and the PRC military attache issued a \"Chinese warning\", which forced Pinochet to retreat. Thus, our influence in Chile has grown noticeably stronger.\r\nThe Chilean opposition is a conglomeration of the most diverse forces - from anti-revisionists to right-wing nationalists. Since we had almost no contacts left there, in order to reach the leading centers of the AD and MDP, we had to use the help of the Minister of the Interior of the Pinochet regime, Sergio Harpa, who led our people to the leaders of the CDA, Eduardo Frei and Patricio Aylwin. Thanks to the assistance of Cuban friends, it was possible to restore ties with the emigrant Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, headed by Luis Corvalan, as well as the leader of the MIR, Pascal Allende. Although there is no need to talk about their trust in us after 1973, both blocs really need outside help, since the Pinochet junta, with the help of the United States, is very effective in suppressing the partisan movement, and negotiations with the dictator have not yet led to anything. After tense negotiations, an agreement was reached on cooperation between China, the Democratic Alliance and the People's Democratic Movement. In addition, the opposition parties agreed, under the influence of the PRC and the USSR, to form the Coordinating Council of Chile. It included: communists Luis Corvalan, Volodya Teitelboim and Gladys Marin, socialists Carlos Altamirano, Ricardo Lagos, Clodomiro Almeida and Raul Ampuero, Christian Democrats Eduardo Frey, Radomiro Tomic, Edgardo Boeninger and Bernardo Leighton, radicals Anselmo Soule and Anibal Palma, and also MIR member Nelson Gutiérrez and head of the anti-revisionist HRC-PD Eduardo Artes. The positions of the opposition are strengthening, but after that the Pinochet regime severed all relations with us and began organizing a new wave of repression, including purging the entire state apparatus of civilians and strengthening control over censorship and state corporations.\r\nThe Pinochet regime, having brutally cracked down on the opposition and coped with disagreements in its ranks (Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force Gustavo Lee, who criticized Pinochet's reforms from neo-fascist positions, was withdrawn from the Government Junta, and the Motherland and Freedom organization was fragmented and ousted from politics), proceeded to its legitimization by adopting a new Constitution instead of the repealed one of 1925. Her project consolidates the neoliberal discourse in the economy and provides for the preservation of the military regime until 1988, after which a referendum on confidence in Augusto Pinochet should be held. The referendum on the new Constitution was held with gross violations (there were no voter lists, no minimum guarantees of voting transparency, but there was severe censorship of the media and the persecution of the opposition and peaceful assemblies in support of the «No» option, there were cases when polling stations of communes in the southern and western sectors of Santiago, such as Pudahuel, La Granja and San Miguel, were composed of residents of the Las Condes district, located in the eastern sector of the Chilean capital) and ended with its adoption with a score of 78%. Thanks to skillful machinations, fraud, propaganda and repression, Pinochet temporarily legitimized his power.\r\nOne step forward, two steps back\r\nThe Chilean military junta of General Pinochet is gradually losing ground - inside the country, left-wing radicals are waging a partisan struggle against it, the influence of the opposition Democratic Alliance and the People's Democratic Movement is growing, from the outside - even the United States stopped supporting the clearly pro-fascist regime and began to put pressure on the junta so that Pinochet at least formally left politics and curtailed the military regime, restoring civilian rule. The help of the Chilean opposition from the USSR and Cuba does not stop, and the economic crisis of 1979 only increased the impoverishment of the people and increased anti-Pinochet sentiments. In this situation, Pinochet and the main ideologue of his regime, Jaime Guzmán, decided to begin a gradual liberalization of the regime - it was announced that in 1990 the junta would cede power to a civilian government and resume the activities of the National Congress, holding multi-party parliamentary elections and elections for a new President of the Republic. According to our intelligence services, only the now hastily created pro-government parties (two center-right and two center-left spoilers) will be admitted to the elections, and Pinochet himself and the spoiler candidate Antonio Zamorano will be nominated for the presidency. But now the opposition is stronger than it used to be...\r\nAssassinate Pinochet (Leninism)\r\nThe armed underground in Chile is not strong enough for that!\r\nProvoke a power transition from Pinochet to moderate Hernan Buchi (liberalism)\r\nThe military is not so dissatisfied with Pinochet as to agree to this.\r\nThanks to joining the fight against the military junta, China was able to restore contacts with the opposition and achieved the unification of the entire armed underground with the pro-Soviet Patriotic Front of Manuel Rodriguez, named after the national hero of Chile. Luis Corvalan, the leader of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Chile, illegally returned to Chile with the help of the USSR and the PRC and actually led the guerrilla after the Democratic Alliance could not agree with Pinochet and his influence waned, and the People's Democratic Movement became radicalized. As a result of the actions of the combat detachments of the PFMR, the military commander of Santiago, General Ursua, the leading ideologist of the regime, Senator Guzman, were eliminated, and the National Flag of O'Higgins, later raised over the Andes, was stolen. Thanks to the assistance of the Chinese intelligence services, the \"Operación Siglo XX\" was carefully designed - an attempt on Pinochet. The site of the attack, the Cuesta de las Achupallas, was a narrow road through the mountains. Nearby, partisans rented a house, posing as seminarians. When Pinochet's motorcade arrived in the chosen area, it came under heavy fire. The terrain did not allow the dictator's guards to use radio communications with nearby military and police units. A rocket-propelled grenade fired from a Soviet grenade launcher hit Pinochet's car, causing the car to explode and burn to the ground, killing the dictator. This was the signal for the beginning of an armed uprising, which the confused military and carabinieri did not expect. Passers-by actively joined the attacks on administrative buildings, and opposition parties supported the rebellion. The regime fell, power in Chile passed to the Transitional National Government, which was headed by Corvalan, the leftist Christian Democrat Radomiro Tomic and the socialist Clodomiro Almeida as co-chairs, the 1925 Constitution was restored and neoliberal reforms were stopped. In the first multi-party elections, the CPC (Hoxhaists), the CPC (Castroists), the CPC (pro-Moscow) and the Christian Democratic Party (Radomiro Tomicha) received an approximately equal number of seats, forming a coalition government.\r\nPinochet's military associates, together with the Democratic Alliance, taking advantage of international pressure and popular discontent, persuaded him to formally leave politics, yielding the post of President and retaining the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Chile. Pinochet's civilian protégé, Hernan Buchi, was approved as the new President of Chile. Bucha's strategy was to create financial conditions for stable export-led growth and to reorganize the production structures of the export sector. Cutbacks in government spending, periodic currency devaluations, and incentives for domestic savings, foreign investment, and capital repatriation have gradually brought inflation down to 12 percent, the lowest level in Latin America. A vigorous campaign to sell public debt packages to private investors in exchange for shares in Chile's industry and the privatization of the pension system and health insurance have reduced the country's debt burden by more than $4 billion. A slow recovery of well-being began after the poverty that Chile fell into after the military coup by Pinochet. At the same time, censorship gradually weakened, the CDP and the Party for Democracy (the legal cover for the socialists) were legalized, and their representatives began to receive some government posts.\r\nAccording to the Constitution of 1980, General Augusto Pinochet continues to exercise the powers of the President of the Republic for another 8 years, for the same period the military regime is maintained. At the same time, the National Renewal and the Independent Democratic Union are created, and some restrictions are removed for the Democratic Alliance parties. In December 1987, Cauce magazine published a report prepared by Eduardo Hamuy in collaboration with the Academy of Christian Humanism, which collected observations made at the 981st polling station in Greater Santiago on the day of the 1980 plebiscite, in which numerous cases of voter fraud were found . Some of the cases reported include invalid ballots that were added to the «Yes» option, people voting more than once, numbered ballots not matching the total votes cast, recounts without observers present to monitor the rigging, and so on. The opposition is waiting for 1988.\r\nMilitary charter\r\nJuan Maria Bordaberry was elected President of Uruguay in 1972 in the midst of an institutional crisis caused by Pacheco's authoritarian rule and the terrorist threat. He continued the authoritarian methods of the previous government, suspending civil liberties, banning trade unions, jailing and killing opposition figures, and appointing military officers to most senior government positions. On June 27, 1973, Bordaberry dissolved Congress, suspended the Constitution, and gave the military and police the power to take any action they deemed necessary to restore order. For the next three years, he ruled by decree with the assistance of the National Security Council (\"KOSENA\"). Gradually Bordaberry became even more authoritarian than his military partners. In June 1976, he proposed a new corporatist constitution that would permanently shut down parties and establish a permanent role for the army in power. It was further than even the military wanted to go, and they forced him to resign. His successor, Alberto Demicheli, issued Institutional Law No. 1, suspending the call for general elections provided for in Article 77, and Institutional Law No. 2, which created the Council of the Nation, also not provided for in the Constitution, giving it the power to appoint the President of the Republic, the President and members of the State Council, members of the Supreme Court, the Court of Disputes and Administrative Cases and the Electoral Court. However, he refuses to issue the next Institutional Laws, according to which a new wave of political repressions should begin, for which he is threatened with resignation from the military.\r\nBy bribing and pressing where it is necessary to convince the military to give the old man a chance (Right dictatorship)\r\nSeize the moment to make trade deals (nothing will change)\r\nDefending the redundancy of a new wave of political repression, Demicheli ratified the National Development Plan, drawn up in 1972 under the Bordaberry government. The applied economic policy aimed at a radical reformulation of the foundations of the economic functioning of the country under the leadership of the technobureaucracy. The reform was to transform the production structures of foreign trade, income distribution, demand and relative prices into the framework of broad economic liberalization and openness. Demicheli was relatively moderate in the civil-military administrations that ruled Uruguay between 1973 and 1985, in that while he was known for his measures, which were seen by pro-democracy supporters as repressive against the government, he did not agree with his military counterparts regarding the extent to which former politicians should be banned from engaging in political activities. His books on jurisprudence were for many years teaching and reference texts in the Faculty of Law of the University of the Republic.\r\nIn 1976, Aparicio Méndez was appointed President of the Republic by the Council of the Nation (a body controlled by the armed forces), a position which he assumed on September 1, signing, among other things, Institutional Law No. 4, which banned the political participation of 15,000 citizens for fifteen years. Also, one of his first acts as president was to issue a decree suspending the political rights of the leaders of all parties. In 1980, he held a plebiscite to amend the constitution and legitimize the existing government, but the majority of voters opposed. He was a tool in the hands of the military, during his reign human rights were violated, thousands were arrested and exiled. The military junta tried to create the appearance of legality of what was happening and presented a draft constitution, which was boycotted by the majority of the population. A specialist in administrative law, Mendez also practiced law at universities, was a professor of administrative law at the Republican University from 1934 to 1955, but left university teaching as a result of a confrontation with a student union, who accused him of promoting Mussolini's fascist regime in Italy.\r\nFailed Pinochet\r\nGregory Alvarez was originally a radical representative of the military junta. His promotion to command of the army created internal divisions within the army. On March 3, 1978, he issued Service Order No. 7738, under which the activities of the Information and Defense Service (IDS) were subordinate to his command. The refusal of the director of the SID, General Amaury Prantl, from such submission led to a 60-day arrest and resignation. In 1980, he tried to organize a constitutional referendum, according to which only three legal parties would remain, approving a single candidate, and the power of the military would be written into the Constitution. After the plebiscite of 1980, in which the will of Uruguayan citizens to return to democratic life is clear, Lieutenant General Alvarez did not want to accept this verdict, and is trying to force the so-called Council of the Nation to transfer the presidency of the republic to him, thereby postponing the return to democracy. At that time, his opponent in the army was General Hugo Medina, who was more inclined to transfer power to the civilian population. With such a split within the military elite of Uruguay, there is every chance to try to interfere in the intra-war elections of the commander in chief.\r\n\"Slightly\" help Hugo Medina (Right dictatorship)\r\nWe have no connections within Uruguay's military junta\r\nPush the military to maintain the appearance of a civilian government (liberalism)\r\nThe civil government in Uruguay is not strong enough\r\nDuring the internal elections, Gregory Alvarez was effectively removed from power, and Hugo Medina took over as commander in chief of the army. At the same time, pro-democratic forces also won the majority of seats in parliament. As part of the negotiations between the military and politicians to leave the dictatorship, Medina was the most open to dialogue within the Armed Forces and agreed to organize national elections in November 1984, guaranteeing the rights and powers of parliamentarians until then, and starting the process of gradual democratization. However, as an army commander, Medina played a key role in the crisis that resulted from the issuance of subpoenas to military personnel accused of serious human rights violations during the dictatorship. Medina stated that the subpoenas were in a safe in his office and he would not hand them over, veiledly threatening de facto insubordination, which created a state of institutional crisis, culminating in the passing of the \"Expiration Law\" which made it impossible to convict anyone for crimes committed during the military junta.\r\nThe government of Alberto Demicheli allowed the pro-democracy forces to gain a foothold until his death, and during the internal parliamentary elections, the pro-democratic parties also won the majority of seats, all this allowed us to convince the military of the need to continue to maintain the mask of a civilian government. Gregory Alvarez's ideas for a full establishment of an open military junta were rejected, and he himself was dismissed. It was agreed between the political forces and the military that the President of the Supreme Court, Rafael Addiego Bruno, would take over the exercise of executive power. During his tenure, he was responsible for one of the most controversial issues in Uruguay's recent history, the \"Expiration Law\" (which made it impossible for anyone to be convicted of crimes committed during the military junta regime), in his voice he confirmed, that the law is constitutional. Despite the approval of the civilian government, power was still in the hands of KOSEN and the military, and the position of vice president remained vacant. During his reign, Bruno was engaged in the restoration and optimization of the legal field of Uruguay in order to prepare the country for the transition to democracy and free elections, which were scheduled for November 1984.\r\nDuring Alvarez's rule, repression was focused on political activists in the country and in Argentina, who committed crimes against humanity in barracks and clandestine bases. He launched a policy of repression, kidnapping and assassination of political opponents and opponents of military rule. The whereabouts of the missing persons are currently being investigated. As he continued his crackdown on trade unions, he lost a lot of popular support, as well as the support of most of the military, so he soon agreed to holding parliamentary and presidential elections in November 1984, preceded by internal elections in 1982, which were won by pro-democratic forces. Alvarez's residence in Montevideo became the center of demonstrators protesting the disappearance of opponents of the 1973-1985 military-civilian administration.\r\nReturn to democracy\r\nThe general elections in Uruguay for the period were held on Sunday 25 November 1984. These elections marked a historic moment: the end of the dictatorship and the return of Uruguay to democracy. Although they were colored by the presence of political prisoners (White leader Wilson Ferreira Aldunate was imprisoned in Trinidad barracks, as was Front Amplista leader Liber Serenyi), in any case, these elections were overseen by the Electoral Court (led by its controller, Nicolás Storace Arros), which did not find violations. Along with the election of the President, the position of Vice-President corresponding to Enrique Tarigo and the positions of 30 senators and 99 deputies voted. The main contenders in the elections are: Julio Maria Sanguinetti, representative of the Colorado party, and who led this military coup; Alberto Sumaran, representative of the liberal-conservative National Party; and Juan José Crotogini, nominated from the Broad Front, a coalition of all forces on the left. The winning candidate will decide the fate of Uruguay for the next few years.\r\nJulio Maria Sanguinetti, Colorado (Social Democracy)\r\nAlberto Sumaran, National Party (Red Tory)\r\nJuan José Crotogini, Broad Front (democratic socialism)\r\nConsidered at the time to be a progressive politician in political matters and more conservative in economic matters, Sanguinetti managed to rehabilitate the image of his party, whose most conservative sections supported the 1973 coup d'état. He immediately lifted the ban on the activities of political parties and leaders who actively opposed the dictatorship, and signed an amnesty for political prisoners. In terms of international relations, Sanguinetti renewed relations with Spain, re-established contacts with communist countries, and played a decisive role in giving impetus to regional economic integration, in line with the goals set out in the South American Association for Integration (ALADI). In the economic sphere, one of the most important goals of the Sanguinetti government was to reduce the external debt of US$510 million. This huge figure, close to the level of national production, began to be repaid by meeting the requirements of the IMF to reduce government spending, austerity and privatization. The confrontation with unions demanding withdrawal from the IMF and non-payment of the public debt was offset by the opening of agreements between political parties to strengthen the consensus among the parties in order to put forward legislation in the common interest. The result of this consensus was the National Agreement, which was signed on 1 April 1986 by the PC, PN, the left-wing Broad Front (FA) and the conservative Unión Cívica (UC). Under his rule, the \"Expiration Law\" was also passed, granting a sort of amnesty to the military who ended up committing crimes against humanity during Uruguay's civil-military dictatorship.\r\nThe populist centre-right party candidate Sumaran has primarily directed efforts towards an intra-party compromise. Although the party had a unanimous opinion on some issues, this opinion differed on other social issues. The compromise agreement resulted in a number of policies that the new president then implemented. In foreign policy, Uruguay took an anti-imperialist stance, establishing contacts with communist countries, Spain, and even applying for membership in the Non-Aligned Movement. At the same time, in social issues, the ban on same-sex marriages and the adoption of children by representatives of non-traditional orientation was legally confirmed, but, at the same time, abortion and euthanasia were decriminalized, and adolescence was raised, from which it is possible to prosecute. In the economic issue, the new leadership took a direct course towards the federalization of the country, and state-owned enterprises were turned into joint-stock companies and transferred under the control of local authorities. The federalization of Uruguay was also accompanied by reforms to decentralize the economy and reduce the intervention of the central authorities in the market (these powers were transferred to local authorities). Along with this, during the presidency of Sumaran, there was a confrontation between the civilian government and the military, who were trying to be held accountable for crimes against humanity. Ultimately, in order to avoid another coup, Parliament condemned the 1973 putsch, but transferred the right to investigate crimes and impose penalties to military courts, thereby appeasing the military, who simply condemned the scapegoats, leaving many others clean and free.\r\nA doctor by the specialty of Crotogini, having come to power, began to rely on a motley coalition of the left. His first decree was a mass amnesty for all who were accused for political reasons, with the return of all political rights to them, and appointed the well-known left-wing retired military Liber Serenyi Mosquera, who was banned from participating in elections after the coup, as Prime Minister. The first reforms related to the nationalization of all spheres of health and education could not pass through parliament without receiving the required number of votes, Lieber resigned, saying \"I cannot negotiate and negotiate with other political forces, with forces of dubious origin. And this , obviously not satisfied with the Broad Front\". The new government launched a moderate package of reforms: the broad development of social security, the widespread development of medicine and new medical technologies, universal educational programs with affordable and free higher education. Such reforms significantly reduced mortality and morbidity, increased purchasing power and were able to create a solid layer of skilled workers, which allowed the recovery of the Uruguayan economy after a decade of military dictatorship. The life of the population is improving, while GDP and investment attractiveness are growing, as is inflation.\r\nEternal President\r\nAlfredo Stroessner established a military dictatorship in Paraguay in 1954 with a military coup. In the first years, all opposition was banned, mass repressions of the left, trade unionists, political activists began, and a tough anti-communist regime was established. In the economic part, the Stroessner regime was inclined towards fascist methods. Ten years later, Stroessner organized a soft liberalization, forming a \"Golden Square\" of his supporters and establishing a civil power with himself at the head, allowing a moderate opposition that does not claim power. At the same time, repression only intensified, and the state apparatus began to merge with mafia structures, forming a cartel economy. By 1978, the impoverishment of the population intensified, and a circle of monopolists closely associated with the mafia formed in the economy. At the same time, only members of the ruling Colorado party could arrange a more or less good life for themselves, however, party leaders and part of the military believe that the anti-communist rhetoric has exhausted itself, and Stroessner's rule has been too long. Before the 1978 elections, Stroessner called a meeting of the Colorado leadership and top generals. He raised the question of whether he should move away from active politics. Most of the meeting participants were categorically against it. However, an opinion was expressed about the admissibility of Stroessner's departure to the \"honorary presidents\" and the nomination of General Andres Rodriguez, the commander of the 1st Army Corps and a relative of Stroessner himself, to the post of head of state. We can try to play on the contradictions between the military, civilians and the \"Golden Square\".\r\nTry to play on contradictions and push Stroessner\r\nGet in touch with the mafia and establish illegal trade deals\r\nThe civilians and the military, in alliance with the Catholic Church and the Pope himself, were able to convince Stroessner to retire honorably by giving him the following guarantees: a nominal position of honorary president (with a seat in the Senate for life), a good pension and summer cottage, and a place for his son. in the new government. Having come to power in the almost uncontested elections of 1978, Andreas Rodriguez began gradual democratic reforms in secret cooperation with the US Embassy and the Vatican: further moderate liberalization of the media, the transition to secret general elections (they used to be not secret, open-air and police oversight), amnesty some political figures. However, the main activity of the new President in his post was the fight against the \"Golden Square\": Minister of the Interior Sabino Montanaro, Minister of Justice and Labor Eugenio Jaque, Minister of Health Adan Godoy, personal secretary of the President Mario Abdo Benitez Sr. First of all, the Minister of Justice and Labor was dismissed and replaced by the eldest son of Gustav Stresser in order to appease the dictator. For the first time, a representative of the opposition, albeit extremely moderate, from the Liberal Party became the new Minister of Health, and Sabino Montanaro, who protested against this, was accused of trying to organize a coup d'état, and the former Stroessner loyalist Edgar Linneo Insfran, returned from disgrace, was appointed in his place. , who during his resignation managed to move to democratic positions. The only one who did not fall under the purge was Mario Abdo, who served as a contact with the mafia and for the new president.\r\nStroessner resolutely withdrew his own offer and announced that he was \"accepting a new victim\" - that is, he remained in the presidency. Stroessner made a serious effort to create a mass base for the regime. Populist motives occupied a significant place in his social, economic and cultural policies. The potential of Colorado, which has long enjoyed the support of a significant part of the peasantry and intelligentsia, was fully used. Peasant, entrepreneurial, trade union, student, church-Catholic, cultural organizations of Stronist orientation were created. They were united by the Commission of Civil Anti-Communist Organizations (Comisión de Entidades Cívicas Anticomunistas, CECA). The Py Nandi remained an important weapon of the regime - the militias were mobilized for Prostressner demonstrations in August 1973, in response to opposition actions. The dictator created a kind of \"system of checks and balances\". Subordinate to Stroessner on the party line, the Py Nandi were an alternative armed force that limited the ambitions of the army command, and death squadrons with leaders from the Colorado Party, who were not formally part of it, were engaged in the physical elimination of all opposition.\r\nDemocratic transition\r\nFormer dictator Stresser took the pushback of the \"Golden Square\" negatively, and adviser Mario Abdo Benitez Sr., together with police chief Francisco Brites and police chief of the capital Ramon Duarte Vera, convinced Stresser to start a new coup attempt to appoint his son Paraguayan Air Force Colonel Gustav Stresser as President. However, this caused a split in the ruling party of Colorado and the military learned about it. The dictator's loyalists won the Colorado convention and took full control of the party. Anti-Strasserist meetings were dispersed by Aquino gangsters. A party purge was carried out, trusted functionaries of the Golden Square were appointed to all significant positions. A violent clash was brewing. The ruling General Rodriguez was joined by influential military men - General Lino Oviedo, Colonels Felix Balmori, Lorenzo Carrillo Melho, Marino Gonzalez, Jose Segovia Boltes. On the night of February 3, 1989, infantry and armored units under the command of Rodriguez surrounded and attacked key administrative buildings and military installations in Asuncion. An attempt to immediately arrest Stroessner failed: the president's guards entered the fray. Stroessner managed to hide in the barracks of his personal guard. He decided to resist and considered it quite possible to suppress the putsch. It was Gustavo Stroessner who persuaded his father to stop resisting (“otherwise we will all be killed”). Negotiations on surrender led with Rodriguez and General Fretes Davalos. By morning, the guard barracks were occupied by the rebels. Andres Rodriguez delivered an address to the nation. He announced the removal of Stroessner from power, announced democratic reforms, promised to continue to respect human rights, cooperate with the Catholic Church, and protect the Romanesque and Catholic traditions of Paraguay. The first free elections in Paraguay began.\r\nJuan Carlos Wasmosi, Colorado Party (Right Dictatorship)\r\nDomingo Laino, ardent liberal oppositionist, PLRA (liberalism)\r\nGulermo Vargas, Representative of the Third Way Social Democrats, PEN (Social Democracy)\r\nGulermo Vargas, Christian Socialist Representative, PEN (Democratic Socialism)\r\nUnder President Andrés Rodriguez, Pedotti Vasmosi served as Minister of Integration in the government of Paraguay. Andrés Rodriguez, the previous President of Paraguay, endorsed Vasmosi as his successor in the presidential election. Wasmoshi managed to win them with 41.6% of the vote for him, his main rival Domingo Laino, representative of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, came in second with 33.5%. In fact, these were the first free elections in the history of Paraguay, where the advantage of the winner over the loser was less than 10% of the vote. Despite a number of revealed violations during the voting, they were considered minor and did not cast doubt on the clear victory of Wasmosi by a team of international observers led by Jimmy Carter. However, Wasmosi became a very unpopular president when he began appointing many longtime supporters of the dictator Alfredo Stroesner to positions in the Paraguayan government. Wasmosi also did not continue the democratic reforms of the previous President Rodriguez, concentrating on maintaining personal power, increasing personal wealth and opening the market to American corporations.\r\nA militant and leader of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA), Domingo Laino opposed the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner from the very moment of its proclamation, being persecuted, arrested, and imprisoned many times. He was in exile until the current elections, when, under intense pressure from mass protesters, he was allowed to return to Paraguay. During his exile, he received many international awards for his defense of human rights and democracy. Under his rule, a massive liberalization of the regime began, unprecedented freedom of the media and political associations was established, and the country became the first in Latin America in terms of democracy. Having democratized the state and made politics completely transparent, Domingo began show trials against military and civilian figures who participated and organized human rights violations and torture in Paraguay during the entire period of Stroessner's dictatorship. This prompted an attempted coup d'état by officer Lino Oviedo, who led the Paraguayan army. Domingo Laino was arrested and expelled from the country for unconstitutional actions and abuse of power, and Lino Oviedo, during mass rallies and demonstrations, announced the transfer of power to the moderate representative of the PLRA, Julius Caesar Franco. The new leadership appointed Lino Oviedo Minister of Defense and ended the persecution of the military, concentrating on the fight against mafia cartels, drug trafficking, the development of medicine and the liberalization of the economy.\r\nThe National Encounter Party was formed as a coalition of the Social Democratic Febrerista Revolutionary Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Asuncion Para Todos, and left-wing Democratic splinter factions of the Colorado Party. PEN has set itself this campaign goal: \"to offer the country the best men and women, the most capable and honest, those who really want to build a republic based on social justice and the rule of law.\" Failing to win a parliamentary majority, Gulermo Vargas decided to form a coalition with the Authentic Radical Liberal Party (PLRA). The resulting centre-left coalition engaged in reforms to expand freedom of speech, pluralism of opinion, mass democratization of the state, the media and the judiciary. Many corrupt officials and mafia accomplices from officials and judges were imprisoned for long periods, and as a compromise, the main officers responsible for violating human rights resigned. Economically, the coalition focused on expanding equality, introducing a progressive tax, social benefits, subsidies, free healthcare, and free universal secondary education. With the goal of improving wealth, health and literacy, PEN has also taken on massive infrastructure projects to create jobs and grow the economy. At the same time, an active struggle was launched against the mafia and drug cartels and a campaign to attract foreign investment.\r\nThe National Encounter Party was formed as a coalition of communist and Castroist movements (previously banned), the Social Democratic Revolutionary Party Febrerista, the Christian Democratic Party, Asuncion Para Todos, and splinter factions of the Democratic Left Colorado Party. United under a program of Christian Socialist Theology of Liberation Theology and funded by Chinese grants, the party was able to garner huge support and secure its candidate, Gulermo Virgas, for the presidency. This prompted an attempted coup d'état by officer Lino Oviedo, who led the Paraguayan army. Gulermo Vargas was arrested and taken to a closed dacha, which caused mass protests by the poor and attacks on the military. The poor crowd surrounded the residence of Lino Ovedo with a hundred thousand people and the military had to let the president go, resign and flee the country. Triumphantly returning to power, Vargas decided to ban the Colorado Party for complicity in crimes against humanity, began mass arrests of participants in the Stresser dictatorship, and a massive purge of the state apparatus, law enforcement agencies and the judiciary. After that, snap elections were announced, in which PEN received a majority of votes and launched broad social reforms: important economic areas were nationalized, free housing was introduced, broad social guarantees, free medicine and secondary and higher education. After that, an attempt began to implement the program for building a socialist market economy and a moderately prosperous society.\r\nDictatorship is not forever\r\nBy the 1980s, dissatisfaction with Stroessner's rule grew sharply in the country as a whole and in the ruling elite. The modernization potential of stronism was largely exhausted. Anti-communist policy was losing relevance against the backdrop of Soviet perestroika. The American administration of R. Reagan expressed dissatisfaction with the dictatorial nature of the regime. The Catholic Church of Paraguay took an active opposition position. Relations within the ruling elite sharply escalated. In a tough confrontation, the army command and the Cuatrinomio de oro (\"Golden Square\"), a group of Stroessner's closest associates from the government and personal office, came together. General Rodriguez fully shared these sentiments. Through his daughter Martha and her husband Alfredo Stroessner, Jr., he tried to convince the president to voluntarily resign. But these attempts failed. The conspirators were led by generals A. Rodriguez, Lino Oviedo, colonels F. Balmori, L. Carrillo Melho, M. Gonzalez, J. Segovia Boltes. The ideological inspirer was the former Minister of the Interior, Edgar Insfran, an ultra-right activist in his youth, then the organizer of repressions and punitive operations, fanatically devoted to Stroessner, but after his resignation, he strongly evolved in a democratic direction. Almost all of the conspirators were, like Rodriguez, close associates of Stroessner.\r\nProvoke Stroessner to attack Rodriger (Right Dictatorship)\r\nProvoke and, through mafia structures, promote Innsfran (proto-fascism)\r\nIn early 1989, President Stroessner, for reasons of financial stabilization, ordered the closure of all exchange offices. This meant a blow to the core business of A. Rodriguez, because. he owned all the exchange offices in the country. During the night, infantry and armored units under the command of A. Rodriguez surrounded and attacked key administrative buildings and military installations in Asuncion. He personally commanded a tank regiment that stormed the presidential palace, the central police barracks and the personal residence of the president. At 5.30 am on February 3, A. Rodriguez delivered an address to the nation in his capacity as interim president. He announced the removal of Stroessner, promised democratic reforms, respect for human rights, protection of the Romanesque and Catholic traditions of Paraguay. Emphasis was placed on complete freedom of expression, renunciation of the political privileges of the Colorado Party, and respectful cooperation with the Catholic Church. President A. Rodriguez formed a new government, abolished the state of siege, which had been in effect for more than 30 years without interruption, and the death penalty. Political prisoners were released, members of the \"Golden Square\", a number of secret police officers, known for their particular cruelty, were arrested. Radical supporters of the overthrown dictator were withdrawn from the party leadership, and major functionaries of Stronism were held accountable for corruption and torture at different times (at the same time, some no less odious security officials from the police and state security were left in the service - R. Duarte Veru, A. Campos Aluma). Many expected that A. Rodriguez would establish his own dictatorship of the Stressner type. These fears were not justified, general secret free elections were scheduled for May 1, 1989.\r\nIn early 1989, President Stroessner, for reasons of financial stabilization, ordered the closure of all exchange offices.

These fears were justified, the new head of government Infsran entered into close cooperation with the mafia and began reforms to legalize it: the drug trade was legalized under the guise of growing coca, mafia cartels were transformed into private corporations with preferential taxation, and mafia leaders firmly entered the ranks of the leadership of the Colorado Party . And although the new regime became more democratic and liberal in comparison with the previous one, Paraguay turned into the center of Latin American drug trafficking, and the economy finally passed into the hands of the legalized mafia, establishing a pseudo-democratic corporate regime with a controlled opposition.\r\nRadiance begins\r\nThe military junta in Peru, led by General Juan Velasco Alvarado, unlike other Latin American juntas, carried out leftist reforms, such as agrarian reform, protection of indigenous cultures, improvement and protection of labor rights and empowerment of trade unions, up to the creation of a syndicalist model of the economy . The negative features of the junta were the seizure of control over the media, total censorship and persecution of the opposition. However, measures such as the nationalization of natural resources and the expropriation of foreign companies, on the one hand, and the rejection of friendship with the Soviet Union, on the other, led to the country's international isolation and economic crisis. In response, in 1975, a coup led by General of Division Francisco Morales Bermudez turned to the IMF and began to comply with the requirements of international financial institutions in exchange for large loans, privatizing, deregulating and democratizing the country. After the Constituent Assembly of 1979, the main candidates in the free elections of 1980 were Fernando Belaunde Terry, a representative of the centrist People's Party, which ruled before the military coup and was the main internal force in the democratization of the regime in 1979, and Armando Villanueva, a candidate from an unusual pan-American socialist party of non-Marxist persuasion, holding reformist and anti-imperialist positions. And last on the list, but not least, are the Maoists from the underground guerrilla movement Shining Path, who refused to participate in the elections and are beginning to create a military-political headquarters to organize a peasant revolution.\r\nFernando Belaunde Terry, People's Party (centrism)\r\nArmando Villanueva, APRA (democratic socialism)\r\nSendero Luminoso, Maoist Partisans and Their Revolution (Left Radicalism)\r\nMaoists won't listen to our revision leadership\r\nOne of Belaunde's first actions after his second coming to power was to return the newspapers seized by the military to their rightful owners, thus freedom of speech was restored, however, he did not want to cancel the expropriation of land carried out as part of the agrarian reform (which eliminated agrarian feudalism in the country). At the same time, the new president tried with all his might to break out of isolation and restore relations with the United States, Britain and France, and achieved great success in this field. In economic policy, Belaunde surrounded himself with a liberal economic team led by Manuel Ulloa, director of the newspaper Expreso and Minister of Economy in his government, who focused on the partial privatization and development of irrigation and road infrastructure projects begun under Belaunde's previous presidency. Although large residential complexes have been built in Lima and various cities, urban and rural infrastructure has been reconstructed almost throughout the country, and a national plan for the supply of drinking water and sanitation has been implemented, most of the privatization and deregulation reforms have not been carried out through parliament. All in all, the new leadership was a breath of fresh air after the last years of the military junta's stagnation.\r\nAPRA initially adhered to pan-Hispanism. Rejecting the Western model of capitalism and Soviet communism, party leader Haya de la Torre believed that Latin America (he preferred the term Indo-America) had its own path of development and should have its own model of a socialist national economy. After the death of the party leader, APRA split into two camps. Two leaders were formed, during the struggle between which the left \"aprist\" Armando Villanueva won. Having come to power, he announced that he would pursue a policy of \"gradual corrections\" of the reforms of the last years of the military junta. He was accused by his rival Townsend of \"ideological deviations and signs of corruption\", but in response he expelled the right wing of the Townsendists from the ARPA, entering into a coalition with the Christian People's Party, the Revolutionary Workers' Party, the Revolutionary Left Union and the Unity of the Left, forming a moderate left parliamentary coalition. The new reforms consisted in a partial return to the reforms of the first half of the military junta: syndicalization of enterprises (workers received a share of shares and the right to vote in accordance with the share, while all enterprises were obliged to share shares of shares with each of their hired workers), expanding the rights of trade unions (up to mandatory membership of a worker in any trade union and the impossibility of concluding a contract without the approval of the trade union of which the worker is a member), the rights of indigenous peoples and labor rights, however, it did not come to the establishment of full workers' control over enterprises, as was the case at the beginning of the military junta, realizing the unpreparedness of the economy for this. Along with this, peasant banks were opened and support for young farmers began. However, the new government guaranteed full freedom of the media, pluralism of opinion and multi-party democracy, in contrast to the military junta, and marked its course towards the creation of pan-Latin American organizations of political and economic persuasion.\r\nTaking advantage of the post-junta confusion and the unwillingness of the new President Fernando Belaunde to use the army to solve problems and forcible suppression (because his rule had already been overthrown by the army), the Shining Path Maoists launched a mass guerrilla movement in rural areas, starting to take under their control village by village and using the support of the poor and landless peasants. Ultimately, Belaunde decided to use the police and the forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs against the growing influence of the Maoists. The hands of the police and the forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were untied to carry out terror, and over time, due to such measures, the implementation of armed struggle under the banner of the \"Shining Path\" became the only means of survival for the poor. This led to a sharp increase in the movement and, ultimately, a \"red peasant campaign\" against the capital of Peru, where administrative buildings were seized and the Shining Path announced the transfer of all power to the new people's government. This caused a reaction from the army, which resulted in a small civil war. To stabilize their power, the Maoists set up swift \"people's courts\" that sentenced to throat slitting, strangulation, stoning, and cremation afterwards. While punishing and even killing cattle thieves, which was popular in Peru, the Shining Path also killed peasants and grassroots activists for minor crimes and any hiring for a reaction. Along with this, the \"Shining Path\" unleashed a war on the \"remnants of the reaction\", destroying cultural and national monuments, traditions and festivities. All this led to a sharp drop in the popularity of the Maoists among the peasants, which was used by Peru's neighbors in the Condor organization and arranged a joint \"peacekeeping mission\", after which, through the mediation of the US Secretary of State, they installed an interim government of Fernando Belaunde and the People's Party.\r\nTaking advantage of the post-junta confusion and the unwillingness of the new President Fernando Belaunde to use the army to solve problems and forcible suppression (because his rule had already been overthrown by the army), the Shining Path Maoists launched a mass guerrilla movement in rural areas, starting to take under their control village by village and using the support of the poor and landless peasants. Ultimately, Belaunde decided to use the police and the forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs against the growing influence of the Maoists.

This led to a sharp increase in the movement and, ultimately, a \"red peasant campaign\" against the capital of Peru, where administrative buildings were seized and the Shining Path announced the transfer of all power to the new people's government. This provoked a reaction from the army, however, the soldiers were publicized and quickly went over to the side of the Maoists, forcing the generals to flee the country. To stabilize their power, the Maoists set up swift \"people's courts\" that sentenced to throat slitting, strangulation, stoning, and cremation afterwards. While punishing and even killing cattle thieves, which was popular in Peru, the Shining Path also killed peasants and grassroots activists for minor crimes and any hiring for a reaction. Along with this, the \"Shining Path\" unleashed a war on the \"remnants of the reaction\", destroying cultural and national monuments, traditions and festivities. All this led to a sharp drop in the popularity of the Maoists among the peasants, support among which dropped to 7%. Then the Shining Path decided to change tactics again and rely on the working class, in particular, universities. Carrying out progressive labor and educational reforms, many workers and students began to support the new government and become functionaries of the new government, as well as join the ranks of \"counter-revolution suppression units\" that were engaged in the elimination of peasant uprisings that broke out here and there. However, in general, the power of the Maoists was established.\r\nElections, elections...\r\nThe 1985 general election in Peru was held on Sunday 14 April. They elected the president and members of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Congress of the Republic. The executive and legislative branches of Peru were completely renewed, and the previous president was confirmed as a senator for life. Due to the high support of the left forces among the people, the confrontation is between the parliamentary extreme left \"United Left\" and the pan-American supporters of the third way \"APRA\". The remaining rightists are the liberal-conservative \"Democratic Convergence\" and the center-right \"People's Party\", but they have a chance to win only by uniting. The first candidate, Alan Garcia, of APRA, comes from an extreme anti-imperialist, anti-North American and anti-communist position, intent on asserting some form of state capitalism and the state's leading role in society. His competitor on the left, Alfonso Barrantes, a former communist and political prisoner, is not only the leader of a literal unification of the left, but also the founder of the city of Waican, a self-governing community governed by direct election of a special amalgamated council from each neighborhood's cooperatives and housing communities. Alan also participated in organizing a social assistance distribution program at the level of the Lima City Hall, of which he was the mayor. And a possible candidate from the DK-NP coalition could be DK representative Lewis Reyes, an ardent supporter of democracy, free speech and an unregulated market economy, and a former mayor of Lima.\r\nAlan Garcia, APRA (Social Democracy)\r\nAlfonso Barrantes, United Left (state socialism)\r\nLewis Reyes, \"DK\" and \"NP\" (Liberalism)\r\nGarcía's economic policy was based on APRA's anti-imperialist values, so he distanced Peru from international markets, which led to a decrease in investment in the country. Garcia also made an attempt to nationalize the banking and insurance industries. The International Monetary Fund and the financial community recoiled after the García administration unilaterally announced a debt repayment cap equal to 10% of gross national product, thereby isolating Peru from international financial markets. This forced the APRA government to start printing money for multiple domestic projects, which led to hyperinflation. General isolation, a sharp withdrawal of foreign capital and enterprises, hyperinflation led not to a decrease, but to an increase in poverty, which brought down the rating of the initially popular Garcia. During the same period, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) arose. The Garcia administration unsuccessfully sought a military solution to the growing terrorism, allegedly committing human rights violations. These include the \"accomarca massacre\", when 47 peasants were shot by armed forces in August 1985; the Kayara massacre (May 1988), in which about thirty people were killed and dozens went missing; and the summary execution of over 200 prisoners during prison riots in Lurigancho, San Juan Bautista and Santa Barbara in 1986. According to an official investigation, about 1,600 enforced disappearances occurred during Garcia's presidency.\r\nHaving come to power, the United Left teamed up with the APRA to obtain a constitutional majority, forming a single leftist government. The first program of President Barrantes was the distribution of the \"Glass of Milk\" to all of Peru - providing essential products to the entire poor population of the country. At the same time, under him, a constitutional reform began, which was carried out in the form of dismantling the entire old bourgeois system and uniting all citizens and peasants into cooperatives and housing associations on a voluntary basis. These cooperatives and housing associations will then elect representatives from themselves to the Management Committees of the regional level, and he, again, representatives from himself - to the unicameral Congress of Peru. At the same time, the new Constitution implied the federalization of Peru, so that cooperatives, housing associations and Management Committees at the local and regional level had broad powers for self-government, and some principles of the old \"left\" military junta were returned to the economy, but with more state intervention: there was the banking sector and the mining and processing sector were nationalized, and the rest of private enterprises were obliged to turn into joint-stock companies, in which each worker was to be provided with a minimum size of the company's shares to share profits. Also, by introducing progressive taxation, the budget received large amounts of money, although the state fell under the sanctions of the United States and the European Union (but not as strong as Cuba), and with the help of these funds a large-scale reform began to spread free medicine and education. The new system effectively cemented the power of the Socialist-Communist-APRA coalition, who are now vying for power among themselves. No one was able to file a complaint against the presidency of Alfonso Barrantes. He showed that the path of honesty is the only correct and popular one in history.\r\nHaving joined the coalition, the Democratic Convergence and the People's Party put forward a single candidate, who was able to win. Lewis Reyes, having come to power, entered into an alliance with the Freedom Movement, and, having received a constitutional majority, set about broad political reforms: the complete privatization of the media and state radio and television channels began, abolishing and banning all censorship, freely allowing foreign newspapers. Mass amnesties were held for all political dissidents, prisoners, refugees, political persecution was also prohibited. Most of the media, however, were bought out by private corporations and became purely commercial. In the economy, due to the large public debt, Reyes decided to cooperate with the IMF and began to fulfill their requirements - to reduce government spending, to privatize all unprofitable enterprises, to reduce taxes and create favorable conditions for foreign investment. The new government was able to overcome inflation and debt, but the well-being of the population still leaves much to be desired.\r\nEnd of the oligarchy\r\nArosemena Monroy became president of Ecuador. During his 20-month term, he promoted reforms, among them cheap housing, progressive income taxes, and annual bonuses for workers. His support for Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution sparked a prolonged conflict with the National Congress and the Ecuadorian military. During his reign, he managed to restore the country's trade balance, reduce external debt and improve the well-being of the population. Despite this, after two unsuccessful attempts to impeach him, Monroy was overthrown in a 1963 military coup. The reason for this was criticism of the US government. The military junta, having consolidated its power, organized a series of repressions, and then transferred power to the civilian government of the oligarch Clemente Erovi. In 1968, the elections were won by the conservative J. M. Velasco Ibarra, who then dissolved the Parliament and the Constitution and established a dictatorial regime, but on February 15, 1972, he was removed as a result of a bloodless military coup, after which power passed to General Guillermo Rodriguez Lara, in which inflation and foreign debt of Ecuador reached an alarmingly high level and in 1976 he was removed from the presidency by a military junta. Over the course of two years, the new junta gradually handed power over to a civilian government that organizes free elections. The favorites are the United Forces of the People (CFP, a left-wing populist party), the Social Christian Party (PSC, cultural conservatives supporting privatization and social guarantees), and the Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party (PLRE, radical liberals seeking to establish an ideal democratic state with a free market economy)\r\nJaime Roldos Aguilera, CFP (democratic socialism)\r\nSixto Duran-Balien, PSC (centrism)\r\nRaul Clemente Huerta, PLRE (Liberalism)\r\nSeeing in the polls a high probability of victory for a prominent opposition figure, Assad Bucarama, the ruling military junta supplemented the Electoral Law with a special article banning him from running for president (as well as former presidents Carlos Arosemena and José Velasco Ibarre). Given this circumstance, J. Roldos was nominated for the presidency by the United People's Forces under the slogan «President - Roldos, Bukaram - in power». After winning the election, he signed decrees to reduce the working week to 40 hours, as well as doubling the minimum wage. He promoted the National Development Plan (through infrastructure development, social projects and government contracts) and a school breakfast program for children. Roldos' most significant contribution was his international human rights policy at the time (it was he who proposed to the Andean Pact the doctrine of respect for human rights, which would outline the principles of universal justice, as well as recognition of the priority of human rights over the principle of non-intervention). The foreign policy of the new President was called the «Roldos Doctrine» and included the unification of Latin America, respect for human rights, democracy, justice, and the fight against juntas and dictatorships. In January 1981, Aguilera Roldos refused an invitation to the inauguration of the President of the United States because of his disagreement with the latter's support for Latin American regimes that violate human rights. Roldos also strengthened his relationship with the Sandist government in Nicaragua and the Revolutionary Democratic Front, which opposed the military dictatorship in El Salvador. This is what some analysts say is the cause of the fire inside the President's plane, which, due to the fire, crashed into a rock, leading to the death of the President and his entire family.\r\nDurand-Ballen's rule was marked by drastic economic reforms: a privatization program was initiated in strategic sectors such as telecommunications, hydrocarbons and electricity generation, with the support of the International Monetary Fund. Under the so-called Washington Consensus, a series of economic measures were introduced that included state cuts, deregulation, privatization of state-owned companies, trade liberalization, broad legal safeguards for foreign investment, and a significant increase in the World Bank's credit line totaling $312 million. As a result, it was possible to significantly reduce inflation, increase foreign exchange reserves, improve the situation of Indian tribes and create a Social Fund, from which financial assistance was allocated to hundreds of small poor communities; under him, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Indian Affairs were also created. At the same time, all these actions contributed to the default of Ecuador on external debts, when the country's obligations reached the amount of 16.4 billion dollars. By the end of his reign, corruption scandals related to the names of members of the government and the president's family, as well as the impeachment of Vice President Alberto Dahica, who was convicted of misusing public funds, reduced his popularity in society.\r\nRaúl Clemente Huerta's presidential term got off to a rocky start as his own party, the Radical Liberal Party, began to split over different visions of liberalism and options for its implementation. In response to this, Professor Raul tried to adopt a compromise program \"Freedom, Justice and Unity\", which consists in: an active anti-globalization foreign policy (as well as withdrawal from the IMF, the adoption of a neutral military status of the country and the fight against foreign military bases in Latin America); the establishment of a transparent rule of law (with free state legal support, elective judges, reducing the influence of the army, universal access to public spending, and so on); building a free market economy (including the full privatization of state-owned enterprises that are not in the field of social services). Such a compromise policy gave its certain results, however, could not prevent the collapse of the party. By the end of Raul's reign, the PLRE had definitively broken up into several irreconcilable currents: moderate liberals, populists, radical liberals, and social democrats. And Raul himself had to form a new government in coalition with the centrists from the PSC in 1983.\r\nSecond election\r\nHaving defeated the military opposition, the civil government in Ecuador was able to form a stable political and legal system and prepare the state for the second, after several military juntas, general free multi-party elections, held in two rounds. Nine parties are vying for the presidency and parliamentary positions, but three of them are the favorites: Leon Febres-Cordero Ribadeneira, candidate of the conservative Social Christian Party; Rodrigo Borja Cevallos, candidate of the Social Democratic Party \"Democratic Left\", a splinter from the Radical Liberal Party; And Angel Duarte, the candidate of the left-wing populist Union of Popular Forces, which, however, is now unable to win a parliamentary majority without creating a coalition with other left parties. The election campaign will be serious, and while the left is split around several parties, all the right are uniting around the Social Christian Party in the National Reconstruction Front, striving to win with all their might.\r\nLeon Febres-Cordero Ribadeneira, PSC (right-wing dictatorship)\r\nRodrigo Borja Cevallos, (ID) (Social Democracy)\r\nAngel Duarte, CFP (democratic socialism)\r\nLeon Febres-Cordero Ribadeneira, when he became president, sought to pursue a policy based on free market relations. However, to implement it, he did not have a majority in the National Congress, as a result of which Ribadeneira resorted to forceful actions: he began issuing \"urgent economic decrees\" to manage public spending and enterprises, which he used to significantly reduce public spending, reduce the state apparatus and restructure (i.e. e., de facto, reduction) in the size and share of state-owned enterprises, creating favorable conditions for the growth of corporations (especially foreign ones). During his reign, the construction of highways and the largest stadiums also took place, the Central Bank of Ecuador annually allocated 5% of the budget for cultural projects. He also promoted a health care and free drug delivery program for children under five called Megramé, which he ran through the Ministry of Health. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights suggests that serious human rights violations took place during Ribadeneira's rule, especially the enforced disappearances of the opposition, as during the military junta. It is alleged that in order to counter the socialist, communist insurgency and movements of indigenous peoples, «death squads» were created under the sanction of the President, intended for mass executions of those caught without trial or investigation.\r\nBorja's government focused on restoring democratic and liberal values: he abolished the Criminal Investigation Service (CIS), declared a torture center, and created the Crime Investigation Department, a body technically equipped to deal with anti-social practices and ensure people's safety. Borja recognized the legal status of the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples (CONAIE) and made many efforts to expand their rights, and also developed a national social rehabilitation plan aimed at creating infrastructure to overcome the physical, psychological and unhealthy condition of prisoners. Borja also dismantled the main drug cartel called Los Reyes Magos and created international cooperation mechanisms to fight drug crime in Latin America. However, at the same time, Borja successfully fought the trade union movement, dispersing rallies and persecuting the leaders of radical trade unions. Takee, the President introduced strict controls on public spending and money emission and redirected public spending in favor of the development of food production sectors for domestic consumption and for export, while the industrial fishing fleet of Ecuador was restored. However, Borja's policies led to a sharp rise in inflation, which will need to be addressed by the government after him.\r\nAngel Duarte was distinguished by outstanding oratory skills, thanks to which he managed to form a coalition of his Rally of the Popular Forces, the left-nationalist Popular Unity (MPD), the Communist Party (PCE) and the moderate socialist Ecuadorian Socialist Party (PSE), thereby creating a full-fledged left bloc United People's Front. In the first months of his reign, he made requests to the State Attorney General's Office to arrest all those who participated in the crimes of past military juntas, and to launch mass investigations. Arrest warrants were issued after high-ranking figures from past juntas flew out of the country, leading to numerous law enforcement resignations and purges. Hundreds of thousands of trade unionists took to the streets, thereby supporting the new leadership. All previously banned trade unions were restored, in particular, the General Union of Workers (UGTE) was declared \"affiliated with the state\" and received subsidies, subsidies and access to all meetings and documents of state bodies (excluding those classified as \"secret\"). The new presidential policy was officially called the \"Policy of Compromise\", relying on the expansion of social programs, labor rights, the development of state industry and infrastructure. The construction of a \"socialist market economy\" and \"reliance on the national labor masses\" were announced.\r\nEnd of the Democratic Dictatorship\r\nThe era of the National Front began in 1958 when the Liberal leader and the Conservative leader wrote the Benidorm Pact, which led to a 16-year era in which Liberals and Conservatives alternated as President every four years and also divided the Parliament equally, thus , in fact, having formed a liberal-conservative two-party dictatorship. The front arose as a consequence of civil wars between liberals and conservatives between 1948 and 1958 and served the purpose of reconciliation and stabilization in the country. While the National Front reduced violence and helped raise the GDP, it led to a stalemate between the two parties. The Liberal and Conservative parties held nearly equal power in both houses of Congress and were unable to push for major reforms with a two-thirds majority, as securing bipartisan support for policies was nearly impossible. This inability to reform gave rise to intra-party factionalism, which manifested itself in the creation of party social movements. The growth of dissident groups opposing the National Front led to the disintegration of the latter and the holding of real popular free elections. The main current candidates are Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, for the Liberals, and Belisario Betancourt Cuartas for the Conservatives. However, if the rest of the opposition parties can really unite with each other in the National Opposition Union, then they will have a chance to turn Colombia finally into a democratic country.\r\nJulio Cesar Turbay Ayala, \"L\" (Right Dictatorship)\r\nBelisario Betancourt Cuartas, \"C\" (Liberalism)\r\nJulius Caesar Pernia, UNO (social democracy)\r\nUnder the administration of Turbay Ayala, partisan groups intensified their terrorist activities throughout the country, to solve this problem, the President decided to create paramilitary organizations of the extreme right - \"death squadrons\" that committed murders without trial or investigation, and a law was passed that expanded the rights of the military in fight against the rebels. The law allowed the army to detain innocent people (until they were found guilty) and torture them, leading to the expulsion of many political activists from the opposition. In the economy, his government emphasized production, security, and employment, with a strong focus on infrastructure development and the electricity sector. However, his economic policies were not successful: the price of coffee (the main export product) fell, inflation and external debt rose, and employment grew only in the \"informal\" sector. Also during his reign, the drug trade underwent rapid changes and its impact on society became evident. A year before taking office, the Medellin drug lords banded together to form the Medellin Cartel. The inaction of the Turbay government led to an increase in cocaine trafficking, increased corruption and political bribery. In terms of foreign policy, the country has moved to the right, showing itself as an ally of the United States.\r\nDuring his presidency, Betancourt began building affordable housing, opened universities, and promoted the fight against illiteracy. Betancourt also negotiated with numerous armed rebel groups; thanks to his efforts, a ceasefire agreement was signed for a period of one year, a mixed commission was created to discuss the process of disarmament and reconciliation, and part of the rebels embarked on the path of legal public activity and political struggle. The Betancourt government contributed to the development of democracy in the country: during his term, the law on the election of the mayor, municipal and judicial reforms, the charter of free television and the law on national holidays were approved. His administration also began exploration and export of coal to boost the economy. Betancourt successfully campaigned against the drug trade and against the integration of \"narcos\" into the official political system of the country. Another key feature of Betancourt during his presidency was the decentralization of Colombia's administrative and financial administration. The municipalities were given wide autonomy in the use of taxes; in addition, the direct election of mayors, who until then had been appointed by provincial governors, was introduced.\r\nThe coalition was formed by the Communist Party of Colombia (pro-Soviet), the Independent Revolutionary Labor Movement (MOIR, Maoists), the Colombian Broad Movement (MAC, moderate left), the National People's Union group (ANAPO, left nationalists), the Christian Democratic Party (Christian Humanists) and Firmes (Social Democrats). The motley coalition was united with only one goal - to conduct a large-scale democratization of the political system and fight against the remnant of a two-party dictatorship. In the first years of the new government, laws were adopted on the democratization of the parliamentary electoral system (in particular, the allocation of state funds to parties for campaigning, the transparency of elections and results, the invitation of foreign observers, the formation of non-partisan commissions, and so on), on the democratization of municipal elections (now the leadership regions were not appointed, but elected by their inhabitants), a large-scale and widespread amnesty, a law on guaranteeing freedom of the media and combating monopolization in the information sphere, investigations and trials of leaders of the Liberal and Conservative parties who participated in the violation of human rights. The main achievement of the new government was a peace agreement with the largest guerrilla organization FARC (leftist Bolivarian underground controlled from Cuba) and the second largest M-19 (National Bolivarian movement seeking to establish democratic socialism). In exchange for laying down their arms and guarantees of non-violence, some members of the FARC and M-19 were given seats in the government and were granted accelerated registration in the form of a legal party \"Alianza Democratica\". However, after carrying out political reforms, the coalition was faced with the impossibility of finding a compromise for the adoption of social and economic reforms. As a result, the coalition collapsed, and the incumbent formed a coalition between ANAPO, CDA and C, starting moderate social reforms while maintaining the status quo in the economy.\r\nSecond chance\r\nBy 1982, there was a guerrilla boom in Colombia due to the prevailing conditions of extreme poverty throughout the country, which led to the strengthening of leftist movements, and if they had the opportunity to legalize, now they would have a chance to come to power legally. At the same time, there was a big boom in cocaine trafficking to the United States in Colombia: drug lords consolidated in the Medellin and Cali cartels, using their fortunes to buy huge farms, animals imported from Africa, etc., and laundering money, investing in social work . In such conditions, the new party that has burst into the light is the New Liberals and their candidate Luiz Carlos Galan with a social-liberal political and economic agenda. At the same time, traditional parties and their representatives also participate in the elections: Belisario Betancur Cuartas from the Conservative Party, standing on the positions of political democracy, cultural conservatism, federalism and economic liberalism; and Alfonso López Michelsen of the Liberal Party, former President of Colombia until 1978, who created the primary industry, streamlined the legal system, and also suppressed labor and union protests and brought the country to peak inflation. Depending on who wins, we will find out if there will be real change for the country.\r\nBelisario Betancourt Cuartas, «C» (Liberalism)\r\nAlfonso Lopez Michelsen, «L» (Right Dictatorship)\r\nLuis Carlos Galan, NL, (social democracy)\r\nAntonio José Navarro, AD (state socialism)\r\nThe partisan movement has not yet come out of the underground\r\nDuring his presidency, Betancourt began building affordable housing, opened universities, and promoted the fight against illiteracy. Betancourt also negotiated with numerous armed rebel groups; thanks to his efforts, a ceasefire agreement was signed for a period of one year, a mixed commission was created to discuss the process of disarmament and reconciliation, and part of the rebels embarked on the path of legal public activity and political struggle. The Betancourt government contributed to the development of democracy in the country: during his term, the law on the election of the mayor, municipal and judicial reforms, the charter of free television and the law on national holidays were approved. His administration also began exploration and export of coal to boost the economy. Betancourt successfully campaigned against the drug trade and against the integration of \"narcos\" into the official political system of the country. Another key feature of Betancourt during his presidency was the decentralization of Colombia's administrative and financial administration. The municipalities were given wide autonomy in the use of taxes; in addition, the direct election of mayors, who until then had been appointed by provincial governors, was introduced.\r\nThe election of Betancourt for a second term clearly showed the success of his policy in the democratization, stabilization and federalization of the country. However, the economic problems remained unresolved, which easily put a heavy burden on the new government. Despite this, the government continued to pay great attention to democracy and the protection of freedom of the media, assembly, opinion, and literature. The judicial system was also significantly democratized: penalties were reduced, new rules for detention and interrogation were established, the inviolability of the presumption of innocence was confirmed, the free and transparent election of judges was approved, closed court proceedings were prohibited. To combat social problems, Betancourt achieved the complete eradication of illiteracy and attracted the Catholic Church to organize extensive charitable programs, even approved by the Pope. Under him, the fight against drugs continued, anti-corruption measures were strengthened, and a ban was introduced on the financing of politicians and political parties by private companies. And to solve economic problems, Betancourt decided to lower taxes and create favorable conditions for attracting foreign capital, giving municipalities the right to conduct direct business with foreign capital. In general, however, such a passive policy did not bring significant results: only a few regions were able to enrich themselves, which led to a sharp migration of the population from others to them and a deepening disproportion in the development of municipalities.\r\nAlfonso López Michelsen's election campaign was headlined with the slogan \"If not Michelsen, then who?\" and sponsored by major drug cortels and related businesses. The election of his candidacy for the presidential elections also split the Liberal Party, leaving there mainly representatives of the \"traditional trend\" that has dominated the past 30 years. As president, Mickelson promoted his \"Democratic Security Policy\"), based on two axes: On the one hand, in regaining control of the territory by the state through the creation of mountain battalions, platoons of peasant soldiers who accompanied the national police in several municipalities and offers of rewards to whistleblowers ; on the other, in an attack on the rearguards of the partisans. Such a broad «counter-terrorist operation» was aimed at the complete destruction of the rebel groups. A huge part of the budget was directed to the expansion of the army, the forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, law enforcement agencies and the military-industrial complex sector, because of which, as a measure to finance the armed conflict, a property tax was introduced to «cover the necessary expenses for ensuring democratic security», determining that taxpayers tax will be all taxpayers with assets of more than 169.5 million Colombian pesos. On the other hand, in order to develop the tourism industry, the government has organized tourist routes protected by the authorities. The main factor in the development of the economy was considered \"non-interference, the development of tourism and the elimination of rebels.\" However, as a result, it was the drug cortels integrated into the state apparatus under the guise of various kinds of legal activities that became the main participant in the economy.\r\nLuis Carlos Galán won the election under the slogan \"Colombia belongs to all its inhabitants\" intending to implement democratic, social and economic reforms. Having come to power, he launched a huge campaign to prosecute drug cartels, declaring it a national program and starting to purge the state apparatus of everyone who was at least somewhat connected with them. This led to him being assassinated on the orders of drug mafia bosses in a public speech in Soacha. It was established that Galan was the victim of an excellent plan, in which many important figures of the country were involved. Vice President Enrique Parejo González became president, who, after contacting army commanders, found out that the Colombian Department of Security was behind the assassination. During the night, the army carried out mass arrests of many leaders of the liberal party, the government, and even the head of the Security Department himself, all of whom were put on trial in the largest investigation in the country. Having concluded a truce agreement with the leftist rebels, Gonzalez announced that the main problem was the drug mafia, not the rebels, after which he began a joint fight against the former. Billions of dollars of property was confiscated from the drug cartels and then privatized, and the resulting funds were used to organize a social program to build housing for the poor, distribute social food, fight unemployment and form government orders for large infrastructure projects to develop the economy and fight unemployment. Towards the end of their reign, a uniting convention of the New Liberals, having lost their leader, took place with the old Liberal Party, purged of the \"traditionalist\" faction. Renewed liberal party about following the course of centre-left, democracy and free market economy.\r\nUpon coming to power, Antonio José Navarro faced a sharp confrontation with the Liberal (L) functionaries who flooded law enforcement and the judiciary and sabotaged José's initial reforms: distributing drinking water to the poor, establishing price controls on medicines, free distribution of crops for peasants to stop grow coca. During this confrontation, the leader of the New Liberals, Luis Carlos Galán, who entered into a temporary alliance with the AD, was assassinated during his speech, as it turned out later, drug cartels, eminent liberal politicians and even the head of the Colombian Security Department were behind this. This led to a hitherto unusual situation: the military entered into an alliance with former leftist guerrillas to carry out a major military operation against drug cartels, which resulted in a civil war - AD, the military and guerrillas, joined by the Conservative Party (\"C\"), entered into an armed confrontation with drug cartels, Liberals (\"L\"), the forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Department of Security. With the support of the international socialist movement, the ruling forces won, the drug dealers were destroyed, the Liberal Party was banned, and many people were given a fair trial. However, at the insistence of the military, the AD did not dare to establish a one-party dictatorship, leaving the old political system, but this did not prevent the AD, which gained immense popularity during the military campaign, from becoming the \"party of power\" and gaining a majority in parliament in re-elections. With this \"people's mandate\", the new authorities began to implement a system similar to Kadarist Hungary: land redistribution, private farming, partial price controls, broad social guarantees, and a state monopoly on trade.\r\nDual system\r\nAfter the 1973 presidential election, it became clear that Venezuela had a two-party system in which only two parties had a real chance of winning the election. Even under these conditions, the left parties, de facto the third political force in the country, again do not have a chance to win the elections if they cannot agree on the nomination of a single candidate instead of four. In general, at the moment there are two main candidates: Luis Herrera Campins from the Social Christian Party, a supporter of strong state intervention in the economy, the development of oil exports and the fight against British influence; and Luis Pinheira Ordaz of Democratic Action, who criticizes the IMF and the World Bank for unfair demands on countries and for the \"global oppression of ordinary workers.\" And if a miracle happens and all leftist forces unite, then the popular and popular critic-journalist José Vicente Rangel has a chance to head a coalition leftist government...\r\nLuis Herrera Campins, COPEI (centrism)\r\nLuis Pinheira Ordaz, AD (Right Dictatorship)\r\nJosé Rangel, MAS-VUC-MDT-MEP-MIR-PCV (democratic socialism)\r\nHerrera won the presidential election, replacing the Social Democrat Carlos Andrés Pérez of the Democratic Action Party (AD), who nationalized the oil industry at the height of the boom in 1975. Oil revenues continued to rise during the early years of Herrera's presidency, who had a dirigiste view of the government's economic role, including diverting public funds to agricultural and industrial projects, paying generous subsidies, and controlling the prices of many goods. As president, Herrera implemented cultural development programs, including building the Teresa Carreño Theater and reforming education. His government continued President Pérez's policy of borrowing from a world market flooded with petrodollars, and by the early 1980s, Venezuela owed the banks more than $20 billion. The government assumed that oil prices would remain high forever and would keep public and private consumption high. However, towards the end of his reign, oil prices collapsed, which, coupled with numerous debts, forced him to liberalize prices, and this led to a sharp increase in inflation and an economic recession.\r\nAfter becoming president, Luis Pinheira Ordaz formed a government led by the previous president, Carlos Pérez. His leadership coincided with a sharp drop in oil prices, which led to an unexpected drop in revenues to Venezuela, whose economy was built on oil exports. In this regard, the new government, despite the pre-election promises of Ordaz, launched a liberal economic policy, known as the \"Washington Consensus\", and based on the recommendations of the IMF. In exchange for unpopular economic and social reforms, such as higher gasoline prices, the country received a $4.5 billion IMF loan. on populist and anti-liberal theses. As a result, the very next year, Caracaso took place - mass protests in the capital, brutally suppressed by Ordaz. And a year later, Venezuelan Attorney General Ramon Escobar Salom accused Perez of misappropriating 250 million bolivars from state funds. This confirmed the revelations of the journalist José Rangel. As a result, the Supreme Court recognized the charges as well-founded, and the next day the Senate voted to strip Perez of his immunity, and then Perez was arrested. This led to a sharp drop in Ordaz's popularity and his resignation.\r\nJose Rangel, a well-known journalist and TV presenter, was elected president not by some \"leftist coalition\", but by the fact that all leftist parties supported his candidacy. This meant that in parliament Rangel had to form a \"blue-red coalition\" of the moderately left anti-imperialists MEP, the centre-left MAS and the economically moderate left but socio-politically conservative COPEI. The new government focused on further democratization and liberalization of the political, legal and judicial system, as well as strengthening antitrust laws, in particular in the media and radio and television broadcasting. The sudden drop in oil prices led to an economic crisis in Venezuela, which caused the coalition to collapse: COPEI demanded cooperation with the IMF and partial liberalization, while MEP and MAS offered IBEC under the CMEA, taking loans from socialist countries and developing internal trade in Latin America. This led to the formation of a government led by an obscure left-wing retired officer, Francisco Cárdenas, who began to form a government from the MBR-200 underground officers' circle. The people called this government \"the first military.\" Despite fears of possible radicalism, the military coup did not happen, only \"extraordinary economic measures\" were introduced - for a period of 200 days, the government took personal control of the monopoly on foreign trade, thereby stabilizing the country's trade and currency balance. Despite the temporary deadline, this led to multiple protests from liberals and conservatives, after which José Rangel promised that he would no longer run for president, stating that politics was not for him and he wanted to return to journalism.\r\nSecond time in two\r\nThe election campaign of 1983 took place against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis in Venezuela caused by the so-called. \"Black Friday\". The main candidates at the moment are: Jaime Lusinchi of Democratic Action, who is advocating a program to solve economic problems by combining a tough economy with critical social programs; and Rafael Caldera of the Social Christian Party, who was already President in the 1960s and now comes from a politically liberal, economically social democratic, and diplomatic national position seeking to protect Latin America from North American/British influence. At the same time, an illegal \"Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement - 200\" is being formed in the army, led by military officers Hugo Chavez and Francisco Cardenas, who adhere to left-wing Bolivarian views of different directions. They see their main task as the liberation of the Venezuelan people from the dictates of big business, foreign corporations and corrupt politicians. But do they have a chance?\r\nJaime Lusinchi, AD (Social Democracy)\r\nRafael Caldera, COPEI (red toryism)\r\nFrancisco Arias Cardenas, GPPSB (state socialism)\r\nMBR-200 did not come out of the underground\r\nJaime Lusinchi, campaigning under the slogans of the need for austerity and social responsibility, was successfully elected President of Venezuela. His first act was to create the Presidential Commission on State Reform (COPRE). She proposed the democratization of regional and governmental political processes (universal, direct and secret elections of governors instead of their appointment by the president and the creation of the figure of a municipal mayor (alcalde)). The economic policy of J. Luchinchi was aimed at stabilizing the economy, repaying foreign debt, reducing government spending, so he immediately introduced an austerity regime in the country, which ultimately led to a further depreciation of the national currency, rising inflation and impoverishment of the population, which aggravated the political crisis. systems. After that, Lusinchi issued a decree on wage increases, price controls, the issuance of currency and back-to-back bonds for subsidies. These measures attempted to alleviate social tensions, which had sharply escalated during the few years of his reign. At the same time, a number of hospitals and residential complexes (a total of 331,615 houses) were built under him, the construction of two hydroelectric power stations was completed, and the construction of the 372-kilometer Eastern Highway began. Thus, Lusinchi's policy was controversial and did not particularly save the country's economy, which is highly dependent on oil exports, however, he himself remained one of the most popular presidents in the history of Venezuela.\r\nRafael Caldera, with support from a range of parties ranging from communists to the center right, won the presidential election with populist promises to uphold sovereignty, fight imperialism, and implement sweeping social reforms. At the same time, he was already president in the 60s, relations with socialist countries were established under him, a broad political amnesty was carried out, the development of the oil sector of the economy began, creating a developed economy and stabilizing the political situation in Venezuela. Having come to power against the background of the oil crisis, due to the excessive dependence of the Venezuelan economy on oil exports, he proclaimed the \"Venezuelan Agenda\" (Venezuela Agenda), a program aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability and reducing inflation. First, due to state intervention in the economy, Caldera managed to stabilize the socio-political situation in the country through social reforms, a number of housing, medical and educational programs and wage increases. However, then, in need of loans from the IMF, Caldera, contrary to his convictions, went on to implement a number of neoliberal measures in the economy: price liberalization, privatization of state property and the devaluation of the bolivar. These decisions were approved by the IMF, but provoked strong protests among the population. A few years later, the gross domestic product grew by more than five percent and the inflation rate was halved. A notable achievement of this administration was the tripartite agreement on labor benefits, social security and pension funds reached between unions, private business and the state after ten years of deadlocked negotiations. Taken together, such a controversial program hurt the popularity of Caldera, however, helped the Venezuelan economy.\r\nGPPSB, a movement formed from several left-wing parties, under the leadership of a retired officer Cardenas, having come to power, began to carry out broad socio-economic reforms: the nationalization of the oil industry, the expansion of the rights of workers and trade unions, and the implementation of broad social programs. This led to the approval of the US embargo, the growth of opposition and the reorientation of trade towards neutral countries and the socialist camp. Such drastic changes alarmed the generals and industrialists, who organized a coup: having taken Cardenas to an unknown place, they approved a provisional government with Pedro Carmona Estang, a major industrialist. This led to popular anger led by officers and soldiers loyal to Interior Minister Hugo Chávez. Sending huge crowds to the center of Carax, with the support of the loyalist group \"MBR-200\" inside the army, Hugo Chavez launched a counter-coup, the generals were arrested, and mid-level officers were promoted. However, Hugo Chavez refused to return Cardeas to the presidency \"for health reasons\", announcing a referendum on the adoption of a new Constitution to protect the \"conquests of the Bolivarian revolution\" - on the approval of the state monopoly on the extraction and sale of raw materials, on foreign trade, on social spheres, and on the formation of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela from the GPPSB coalition. After the referendum gained 78.1% of the votes in support, one-party rule was established in the country, however, voters got the right to recall their elected deputies, governors and even the president, and to initiate referendums on certain issues, thereby creating \" balance between the power of the party and the people\". A new economic policy was also announced, somewhat reminiscent of an analogue of the Soviet NEP with a mixture of the idea of ​​Latin American integration.\r\nWheel of Samsara (Guyana)\r\nInitially, Jagan and Burnham were in the same party, however, Churchill's victory caused concern due to his possible connection with the USSR and, soon, Burnham created a moderate split from the People's Progressive Party, creating the People's National Congress and, with the support of the British authorities, received power in the country. By reorganizing the electoral geography, placing loyal people in the police and expanding the powers of the police and special services to unlimited, as well as giving social guarantees to the black population and political posts to representatives of local Indians, Burnham severed all trade ties with Britain, introduced a complete ban on imports and autarky. The country was transformed into the \"Cooperative Republic of Guyana\", all large and foreign enterprises were nationalized, a program was adopted to provide food, work and housing for all citizens, all political privileges of the British government were abolished, and political repression of critics of the regime began. All government positions were transferred to members of the NOC, and the country established diplomatic ties with Cuba and the USSR, joining the Non-Aligned Movement. But constant repression and bloody strike crackdowns, as well as an economic recession caused by a drop in the sugar crop, led to a sharp deterioration in Burnham's political situation. A new Constitution was adopted: the leading role of the NOC was abolished, and the National Assembly, elected in secret multi-party elections, began to approve the President. Burnham is suspected of fraud, but a candidate with a more leftist program, Jagan and Singh, from a more or less large right-liberal party, has come forward, but the latter will not stand a chance if he cannot unite with other opposition forces.\r\nForbes Burnham, PNC (Democratic Socialism)\r\nCheddi Jagan, PPP (State Socialism)\r\nMarcellus Fielden Singh, TUF-WPVP-LP-PDM (Red Tory)\r\nOn December 15, 1980, the NOC received 77% of the popular vote and 43 seats in parliament as a result of the elections, plus another 10 by decision of the regional councils. NPP and OS received 10 and 2 places respectively. The WPVP did not participate in the elections, assuming the falsification of the results in advance. These suspicions were confirmed by a delegation of foreign observers led by the British Lord Avebury. The economic crisis that Guyana faced in the early 1980s intensified markedly, accompanied by deteriorating infrastructure and a general decline in living standards. Almost every day there were power cuts, the quality of water became unsatisfactory. Adding to evidence of Guyana's decline were shortages of rice and sugar (due to crop failures), edible oil and kerosene. While the official economy was in decline, the black market began to flourish. In the middle of this difficult period, Burnham needed a throat operation. On August 6, 1985, under the care of Cuban doctors, the first and only leader of independent Guyana died suddenly. His era was interrupted suddenly, and suddenly the country entered a new era.\r\nAn unexpected outcome was the victory of Jagan from the NPP. After a twenty-year absence, he again came to power, however, despite this, as they say, due to fraud, according to the results of the parliamentary elections, the NOCs received 22 seats, plus another 10 by decision of the regional councils. NPP and OS received 21 and 2 seats respectively. The result obtained could cause a parliamentary crisis, but Burnham was afraid of massive popular unrest and entered into a coalition with the NPP. As a result of the compromise, Jagan became President, and Burnham again became Prime Minister, just like most of the ministerial portfolios went to the NOC. Faced with an economic crisis, in particular a drop in crops and a lack of funds to support infrastructure, Jagan tried to borrow from the IMF, however, due to demands for privatization, he abandoned this decision and received loans from various countries of the socialist camp. The autarchy was softened, imports from the countries of the socialist camp of goods not produced in the country were opened. Experts from the GDR, Romania and Cuba were also invited to optimize and effectively develop infrastructure, medicine and education, and Guyanese specialists began to go to study in Moscow and Beijing. This made it possible to temporarily solve socio-economic problems, but the economy entered stagnation, and debts will have to be paid sooner or later.\r\nSingh was able to negotiate with the right-wing radical Liberal Party, the centrist People's Democratic Movement and the Maoist Workers' People's Vanguard Party to form a united left-right Vanguard for Liberation and Democracy. However, despite this, as they say, due to fraud, according to the results of the parliamentary elections, the NOCs received 22 seats, plus another 10 by decision of the regional councils. NPP and OS received 7 and 16 seats, respectively. The result obtained could cause a parliamentary crisis, but Burnham was afraid of massive popular unrest and entered into a coalition with the ANM. As a result of the compromise, Singh became President, and Burnham again became Prime Minister, just like most of the ministerial portfolios went to the NOC. However, all Singh's attempts to promote reforms on political liberalization and democratization of the state failed in the National Assembly over and over again, which led to the resignation of Singh under the pressure of the threat of breaking the coalition and the creation of a new one from the CHP and the NPP. Brindley Benn, the black founder of the Maoist RNAP, intercepted the championship branch, who, despite this, quickly and easily found a common language with the right-wing members of the coalition. Faced with an economic crisis, in particular, a drop in crops and a lack of funds to support infrastructure, Benn took loans from the IMF in exchange for the privatization of an unprofitable part of the public sector, in particular, agricultural enterprises, and with the money received, he upgraded infrastructure and agricultural equipment, thanks to which he restored the budget surplus and increased the pace of sugar exports. However, debts will still have to be paid sooner or later.\r\nThe Demise of the Great Helmsman\r\nThroughout his reign, Forbes Burnham remained a powerful figure and the patriarch of Guyanese politics. Even when he collaborated with Jagan and allowed the existence of the right-liberal opposition, he still remained in fact the main puppeteer of the entire Cooperative Republic. However, Burnham recently required throat surgery. On August 6, 1985, under the care of Cuban doctors, the first and main leader of independent Guyana suddenly died. His era was interrupted suddenly, and suddenly the country entered a new era. Will the National People's Congress be able to effect a smooth transfer of power to Burnham's successor and closest friend, Hugh Desmond Hoyt. The other candidate is the longtime opposition People's Progressive Party and its all-time leader, Cheddi Jagan, who was previously accused by the British of being a Marxist-Leninist sympathizer and a \"Trojan horse\" of Soviet influence in South America. And the latest candidate is Brindley Benn, who formed the Workers' People's Alliance from the Maoist Workers' People's Vanguard Party, ASCRIA (representing African-American interests) and IPRAR (representing indigenous Indian interests). However, he only has a chance if he tries again to unite with right-wing opposition parties.\r\nHugh Desmond Hoyt, PNC (Right Dictatorship)\r\nCheddi Jagan, PPP (State Socialism)\r\nCheddi Jagan, PPP (Red Tory)\r\nBrindley Benn, WPVP-ASCRIA-IPRAR-LP-PDM (proto-fascism)\r\nBenn has too little political influence in the country\r\nShortly before the election, Hoyt and other members of the PNC began negotiations with the opposition People's Progressive Party in an attempt to reach a formula of national unity to solve the country's problems. Hoyt declared his willingness to continue the dialogue and, as a gesture of cosmetic reform, banned overseas, proxy, and mail-in voting. Accusing the government of fraud, the opposition boycotted the municipal elections of 1986, as a result, the NOC won all the seats at the local level, embarking on state reforms. Restoring the economy proved to be a major challenge for the government. Hoyt's first step was to increase the share of the private sector: socialism was abandoned, the development of a market economy and private entrepreneurship became a priority for the state, price controls were removed, and incentives for private entrepreneurship were organized. In 1988, the Hoyt administration removed all barriers to foreign companies operating in the country and, in doing so, finally abandoned the idea of ​​autarky. However, there was no need to talk about democratization - in 1990, Hoyt introduced a state of emergency, postponed elections and leased large tracts of equatorial forests to foreign corporations.\r\nAn unexpected outcome was the victory of Jagan from the NPP. After a twenty-year absence, he again came to power, however, despite this, as they say, due to fraud, according to the results of the parliamentary elections, the NOCs received 22 seats, plus another 10 by decision of the regional councils. NPP and OS received 21 and 2 seats respectively. The result could cause a parliamentary crisis, but Hoyt was afraid of mass popular unrest and entered into a coalition with the NPP. As a result of the compromise, Jagan became the President, and Hoyt became the Prime Minister, just like the majority of ministerial portfolios went to the NOC. Faced with an economic crisis, in particular a drop in crops and a lack of funds to support infrastructure, Jagan tried to borrow from the IMF, however, due to demands for privatization, he abandoned this decision and received loans from various countries of the socialist camp. The autarchy was softened, imports from the countries of the socialist camp of goods not produced in the country were opened. Experts from the GDR, Romania and Cuba were also invited to optimize and effectively develop infrastructure, medicine and education, and Guyanese specialists began to go to study in Moscow and Beijing. This made it possible to temporarily solve socio-economic problems, but the economy entered stagnation, and debts will have to be paid sooner or later.\r\nThe second term of Jagan Cheddi began with exactly the same problems as the last one ended - the stagnation of the economy and debts to the socialist camp. Contrary to former fears of foreigners, he ruled as a democratic socialist, not as a Marxist-Leninist. Not wanting to continue to take help from the socialist camp for fear of losing the independence of his country and becoming dependent on another, Jagan decided to take loans from the IMF in exchange for the privatization of an unprofitable part of the public sector, in particular, agricultural enterprises, and with the money he received, he modernized infrastructure and agricultural machinery, thanks to which he restored the budget surplus and increased the pace of sugar exports. At the same time, Jagan supported the trade union movement and invested in infrastructure development. At the same time, Jagan supported the trade union movement, passing new laws aimed at its protection, development and the mandatory participation of trade unions in hiring workers. The country has officially set a course for building a \"cooperative market economy\" and creating a \"social-oriented state\".\r\nSkillfully combining the rhetoric of support for blacks, Indians, small businesses, workers and peasants, Brindley Benn's left-right coalition managed to take second place in the National Assembly, while the NNC, having won first place, could not even get 50% of the seats. This led to internal conflicts within the NOC, the rise of factionalism, and Hoyt's resignation as party leader. Then, in coalition negotiations, the Maoist WPVP, the pro-African American ASCRIA, the pro-Indian IPRAR, and the NOC itself were triumphantly united into a single party, the Workers' People's Alliance. Although, without recognizing the decision of the last congress, the left wing broke away from the NNC, and the Liberal Party and the People's Democratic Movement left the Benn coalition, but the resulting new RNA party captured 79% of the seats in the National Assembly. The new government accused the old one of revisionism, and the right opposition of working for foreign intelligence, and introduced a state of emergency in the country: repressions began both against the left-wing breakaway of the former NOC, and against right-wing parties and even the NOV. Jagan himself fled the country. At the same time, Benn announced a new ideology of the state - National Maoism, based on \"a gradual transition to socialism with Latin American characteristics.\" Declaring that Guyana was not yet ready for socialism, the leadership reported on the complete privatization of agriculture, the abolition of autarky, and the admission of foreign enterprises to the country. At the same time, high duties were imposed on goods produced in Guyana itself, and foreign enterprises were obliged to be formed on the basis of concessions, where at least 40% should have been owned by a citizen of Guyana. The trade union strikes that responded to such drastic market reforms were bloodily dispersed, and the trade union movement itself was banned, instead the State Association for the Interaction of Workers and Employers was created, aimed at \"ensuring honest and fair interaction between the worker and his employer.\" The economy and GDP of Guyana began to grow rapidly, however, the welfare of urban residents, in spite of this, fell, while the wealth of farmers accumulated on a huge scale.\r\nYoung country\r\nThe reign of the first President of Suriname, Johan Ferrier (from the social democratic National Party of Suriname), was marked by economic recession, rising unemployment and government corruption. The hastily created Surinamese National Army had many non-commissioned officers who tried to unionize and complained about corruption and low wages. Prime Minister Henk Arron refused to recognize them and arrested the instigators, prompting a military coup on February 25, 1980. It was organized by the head of the military union, Senior Sergeant Desi Bouterse, with the help of 15 other sergeants. Bouterse began to rule Suriname as the head of the National Military Council he created. He dissolved parliament, abolished the constitution, introduced a state of emergency in the country and created a special tribunal that tried the cases of members of the former government and big businessmen. Relations with the former mother country, the Netherlands, cooled sharply, but relations with Cuba and socialist-oriented Latin American countries strengthened. Six months later, President Johan Ferrier resigns under pressure from the military, and Chin Ah Sen (of the left-wing populist Nationalist Republican Party) is installed by the military as the new president of Suriname. Chin Ah Sen forms a left-wing cabinet that also includes two members of the National Military Council. However, soon Buterse and Chin Ah Sen quarreled, as the latter wanted the establishment of a civilian government, and the former wanted to maintain a military one. What will happen next? And will right-opposition military circles take advantage of this discord?\r\nDesi Bouterse Survives all coup attempts (State Socialism)\r\nJang Ah Sen negotiates successfully with other officers (red tory)\r\nRambokus and Hawker launch a successful coup (proto-fascism)\r\nIn September, Chin Ah Sen announced a draft constitutional reform that would limit the role of the national military to an oversight role within the government. In response, the army formed the People's Revolutionary Front, a political alliance led by Bouterse and two other military officers from the military council, as well as three leaders of student associations and unions. Chin Ah Sen was dismissed and expelled from the country. In the first years of the established regime, Bouterse emphasized his anti-imperialist orientation, declared the proximity of the Surinamese revolutionary process to the Grenadian revolution, personal friendly ties with its leader Maurice Bishop, and repeatedly met with Fidel Castro. He pursued a policy of complete nationalization of industry and the fight against dissidents. After the Netherlands imposed sanctions on Suriname and canceled the payment of subsidies for the repression of the far left, liberal and right opposition, Bouterse said that \"we don't care, we have more than 20 times your subsidies in the budget\" , sharply worsened relations with the Netherlands, but established closer relations with Cuba, Nicaragua, Guyana, Venezuela. However, after the US invasion of Grenada, Bouterse stopped the course of cooperation with the socialist camp and confrontation with the West, and took a course to restore relations with the Netherlands, trying to adhere to the policy of being \"between\" the socialist and capitalist worlds.\r\nIn September, Chin Ah Sen announced a draft constitutional reform that would limit the role of the national military to an oversight role within the government. In response, Bouterse tried to form the People's Revolutionary Front to remove Chin Ah Sen, but the latter was able to enlist the support of the rest of the \"sergeants\" by promising them certain influence and immunity, as well as guaranteeing the left orientation of his rule, at the same time enlisting the support of the former president. Johan Ferrier, who organized rallies in support of Chin Ah Sung against Bouterse. From the moderate representatives of the Nationalist Republican Party, as well as the \"sergeants\" who supported him, he formed the Workers' Party of Suriname, which officially proclaimed \"sovereignism, laborism and following the legacy of the 1980 popular revolution\" as its ideology. The new Constitution adopted by Chin Ah Sen, proclaiming the complete transfer of power to a popularly elected civilian government and parliament, and all military political organizations were dissolved, at the same time, the military retained the right, in case of a critical situation in the country, to dismiss the President, dissolve parliament and organize early election. Under the new Constitution, only parties that did not threaten the authorities were admitted to the first elections, at the same time, a multi-party system and freedom of the press were restored, repressions against trade unions were stopped and independent trade union organizations were restored. Suriname declared itself a \"cooperative republic\" following the path of building a \"people's cooperative economy.\"\r\nRambokus was not a member of the 1980 coup, however he was initially sympathetic to the \"NCOs\" cause. However, as time went on, Rambokus became increasingly critical of the regime, as believed that soldiers had no place in the center of power, and the new regime was mired in corruption just like the old one. On the night of March 10/11, 1982, Rambokus released from prison Sergeant Major Wilfred Hawker, the leader of the 1980 coup attempt that Hawker was attempting with right-wing officers. Together they took control of the Memre Boeko barracks, in the capital of Suriname. The new putschists called themselves the National Liberation Council. Their plan was to attack Fort Zeelandia (freeing all political prisoners) and Bouterse headquarters with tank support. The \"sergeants\" were arrested, and Bouterse was killed in action. Professor Baal Umrausingh was appointed as the new President, and all power was concentrated in the hands of the FNL. The new government approved the orientation towards building an organic state of all-class solidarity, regardless of religion and nation. A large-scale privatization has been carried out, at the same time, grandiose projects have been launched to develop infrastructure, the merchant fleet, medical institutions and the education system. At the same time, the persecution of trade union organizations and free media continued. And the new Constitution, along with full equality, introduced a new upper house, elected by the Unified State Trade Union and representatives of the Council of Corporations. The opposition called the established regime \"neo-fascism\", while the authorities themselves formed the \"Front for Democracy and Development\" with the official ideology in the form of \"Laborism with Surinamese specifics, advocating equality and popular solidarity.\" Thus power was handed over to a motley political coalition of Christian Democrats, liberal conservatives, and Third Way populists.\r\nThe younger generation\r\nThe Yuan Shikai case\r\nMafia Alliance\r\nReject the proletariat\r\nRestoration of the old Brotherhood\r\nThe time has come for the old generation of \"revolutionaries\" to transfer power to the young, or we risk finding ourselves in a situation where the multiple deaths of old party members will lead to a power vacuum and crisis.

The position of President for life, legal almost comprehensive powers, a cult of personality and a broad campaign to popularize his son among cultural and political meetings, conferences and speeches, while trying in every possible way to emphasize the decadent and corrupt role of the Kuomintang in Chinese history, which leads to multiple rumors that Zhu Rongji is very similar in his actions to the deceased the self-proclaimed Emperor Yuan Shikai and may soon also declare himself the new Emperor of China ...\r\nNothing significant has happened\r\nBack to the villages!\r\nAt the first stage, the eviction of urban residents to rural areas, the liquidation of many institutions and services of the state, the persecution of Buddhist monks and in general a complete ban on any religions, the physical destruction of officials and military personnel of the former regime at all levels, former owners of plantations and large farms took place. All citizens became obliged to work, and the country was turned into agricultural labor communes, where the working day often reached 14 hours - in particular, on laying irrigation facilities, changing channels and turning river mouths, planting forest belts, and so on, which was declared a \"temporary measure\" for the total transformation of all natural areas of China for cultivation agricultural crops. The task was set \"the complete elimination of infertile lands in China.\" The socialized children were isolated in special camps, where they were supposed to instill in them a love of work, the field and the current government, as well as make them hate cities and industry. The \"laws of Hammurabi\" triumphed: the death penalty was threatened and carried out for the slightest offense. The language was also reformed to \"return to the roots\" - all forms of politeness and gender were abolished, academic words were excluded, complex phrases were simplified. In the end, China became almost completely isolated from the outside world, full-fledged diplomatic contacts were maintained only with neighboring countries and then only in order to protect its borders from unwanted ties.\r\nWe are not primitivists yet...\r\nНе подружили балканские страны\r\nUnite the Arab countries\r\nPan-Arab tendencies in the Middle East have been on the rise for decades, but each project of unification into a single state has inevitably failed.

Continuing his reign, Chernenko, along with new party ideologues Richard Kosolapov, Viktor Pribytkov and Vadim Pechenev, opened and held the 1986 CPSU Congress, rescheduled for November 1985, where a stunning programme was adopted: in the political part, Stalin was completely rehabilitated, although some of his minor mistakes were acknowledged, and the blame for de-Stalinisation and economic problems was placed on a group of voluntarist lunatics Khrushchev, Malenkov and Shelepin, while Brezhnev was kept tactically in the dark; in the ideological part, a shocking statement was made - the USSR has not yet achieved socialism and is only at a transitional stage on the road to it and that the attempt to declare socialism in the USSR is only a consequence of the catch-and-overtake policy of Khrushchev, when in fact, socialism involves the establishment of full people's power and the complete commonization of production; at the same time, the most moderate part of the programme was economic - it approved the project \"Acceleration\", including the orientation of the five-year plan on computerisation and scientific progress, and production - on intensive production instead of extensive one. {0}This unexpected programme of the Party caused serious setbacks for the Soviet Union. {0}This unexpected programme of the Party caused serious furore and even accusations abroad, but it strengthened Kosolapov's authority and position. At the same congress, the so-called \"reformers\" led by Gorbachev were defeated, who were characterised as \"overNEPmen\". Pribytkov became the ideologist of the CPSU Central Committee and Pechenev became the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. At the same time Kosolapov's project of \"transition to genuine people's power\" began: believing that Stalin had intended to separate the CPSU from the administration of the state and transfer to it purely ideological functions, but seeking to improve this programme with an electronic form of democracy. As part of the reform, an internal Soviet intranet was urgently implemented, and personal computers, though weak in performance, became as commonplace among Soviet citizens as television had been previously. At the same time, the computer and intranet became commonplace for the state apparatus and for communication and commodity exchange of citizens. And in 1991, the new Congress of the CPSU approved a programme to implement people's power in the hope of both bringing socialism closer and dealing a crushing blow to the bureaucracy, giving an impetus to economic growth. Under the draft reforms, the CPSU lost the right to nominate candidates, elections became alternative, and anyone could run for office. However, both internal dissidents like Sakharov and external dissidents like Limonov were not allowed to participate in the elections, as the articles on anti-Soviet agitation and counter-revolution were kept intact, along with the penalty of electoral disenfranchisement. This was done both to protect the proletariat and to appease the party. For the same purpose, the reforms were declared to be \"a continuation of Stalin's policy\" and \"the realisation of Stalin's early plans.\" {0}However, the result of the elections was extremely different from Kosolapov's expectations: in the local councils and the Supreme Soviet got a lot of representatives of ideologies that differ from the general line of Richard, from Trotskyists and Maoists to democratic socialists and left-wing nationalists. And the threat loomed over Kosolapov that he would not only not be elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, but would be expelled from the CPSU altogether, and even the closest associates of the General Secretary turned away from him and stood on different sides of the barricades: Pribytkov declared the reforms \"too excessive\" and was already assembling a team of \"extinguishers\", and Pechenev joined the group of the Russian-nationalist bloc of deputies and intended to use it to \"turn the vector of policy towards Russocentrism\". And the army and the KGB do not consider the situation a crisis to interfere in political squabbles, maintaining a neutral position.\r\nSoviet citizens, having seen the successes of Trotskyism abroad, began to be infected by this promising idea, which was greatly helped not only by the formerly marginal Trotskyist underground cells, but also by the recently introduced intranet. Thus, in a few years, the opposition, which was extremely small in numbers, was able to grow into a real force with many millions of supporters and to gain a huge share of seats in the Supreme Soviet. But the Trotskyists did not have enough seats to form a government and so they entered into a coalition with a reformist parliamentary group of CPSU members led by Anatoly Lukyanov and a parliamentary group of left-wing intellectuals led by Roy Medvedev, which emerged thanks to free elections. This coalition was forced to adopt a compromise programme for both sides: Trotskyist Alexander Tarasov was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Trotskyist Natalia Magnat was confirmed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, punitive psychiatry was banned, dissidents and left-wing political prisoners were released and rehabilitated, workers' control in enterprises was restored through the revival of factory committees, and trade unions were allowed and separated from the state. But further reforms were stalled because of fundamental contradictions in the formulation of a political programme: the Trotskyists wanted to ban the CPSU and create a new Communist Party, while the reformists and intellectuals wanted to simply allow multi-partyism. This discord gave the CPSU enough time to reconstitute and reorganise: the Central Committee elected a new Politburo of fairly young, decisive and tough politicians, with Boris Pugo as General Secretary. The first thing the new Politburo did was to hit the reformist CPSU deputies - expelling them from the party and replacing them with loyalist deputies. Thus the coalition majority collapsed and the parliament found itself in limbo, where rarely any law is passed. For now, until the next election, all parties are just trying to keep the system working as it is, actively preparing to take revenge in the future. {0}It is interesting that everything that is happening allowed the newspaper \"Literaturnaya Rossiya\" to publish an interview of Felix Chuev with the old Stalinist Lazar Kaganovich, which ended with the following expression of his: \"I thought Nikitka was a Trotskyist. It turned out that he was nothing compared to you.\"\r\nSoviet citizens, having seen the successes of Maoism abroad, began to be infected by this promising idea, which was greatly helped not only by the previously marginal Maoist underground cells, but also by the recently introduced intranet. Thus, within a few years, an extremely small opposition was able to grow into a real force with many millions of supporters and gain a huge share of seats in the Supreme Council. The Maoist electoral department was based on the resources of the underground Party of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and was able to attract mainly the electorate of factory workers, miners and workers of non-intellectual labour, but because of this the Maoists were unable to win a majority of seats in the Supreme Soviet. Grigory Isaev then announced a new tactic: workers and miners were brought out for numerous rallies, and protesters began blocking main streets and gathering near administrative and CPSU buildings. On behalf of all the protesters, the Maoist organising bureau made a single demand: the transfer of the extraordinary right to form the Council of Ministers to the Maoist bloc of deputies. Attempts by the KGB to arrest the protest leaders were repulsed by the angry mob and the CPSU Central Committee, disorganised by recent reforms, decided to negotiate with the rioters. As a result of the negotiations, the KGB leadership was arrested and convicted, and the USSR held re-elections in which the Maoists were able to win a majority sufficient to form a government. In the next step, the CPSU was legally banned, and its leaders were tried for \"revisionism and capitalist-roadings\". The immunity of the deputies of the councils was also withdrawn, large-scale arrests began, and demonstrations against these steps were dispersed by armed miners. Thus one single-party dictatorship was replaced by another. And the new authorities immediately began the widespread eradication of the \"legacy of the Khrushchev clique\": the fight against bureaucracy and the elimination of the \"capitalist way of life\". However, along with arrests, staff purges and a change of ideological doctrine, Grigory Isaev, the chief leader of the USSR, declared that he was going to implement \"Comrade Razlatsky's programme to strengthen the power of the proletariat in the country and to fight the bureaucracy and the red directors while maintaining the leading role of the vanguard party.\" As part of this, the right to stakings and strikes by workers was completely deregulated and made absolutely free, and workers' committees with extensive administrative and punitive rights were formed in every factory and enterprise. \"The party must lead the state through its leaders and the same party must fight both the state and its leaders\" - this became the new slogan of the whole country. {0}It is interesting that everything that is happening allowed the newspaper \"Literaturnaya Rossiya\" to publish an interview of Felix Chuev with the old Stalinist Lazar Kaganovich, which ended with the following expression of his: \"'What a bunch of Maoist cubs. Could it be that Nikitka was right to break off relations with the Chinese?\"\r\nKosolapov felt betrayed on all sides and then Chinese intelligence through the Chinese embassy stepped in. China arranged a meeting between Richard Kosolapov, Defence Minister Sergei Sokolov and Chief of the General Staff Sergei Akhromeev. During the negotiations, the Chinese representatives and Kosolapov himself convinced the military that because of Pechenyov and Pribytkov's dastardly stab in the back, the situation in the country was out of control and the Soviet Union was on the verge of its demise. Eventually, with the support of the army, an emergency Congress of the CPSU was organised, where mostly Kosolapov loyalists from all over the country were brought in, and at which Kosolapov was re-elected General Secretary, Pechenev and Pribytkov were expelled from the CPSU, and the Politburo was filled with the \"young Stalinist\" Viktor Anpilov, the odious writer Vladimir Bushin, the anti-Brezhnevist philosopher Mikhail Popov and the editor of Sovetskaya Rossia Valentin Chikin. The CPSU was purged of \"revisionists, bureaucrats, and opportunists,\" its membership was reduced from 7 million to 2 million, and its membership criteria were tightened. Then, while the Supreme Soviet was still unable to elect a new Council of Ministers, armed forces were brought into all the major cities and the Interior Ministry cordoned off all squares and centres. Television broadcast speeches by the newly appointed members of the CPSU Central Committee Politburo, whose addresses generally summed up in one thought: \"counter-revolutionary and reactionary forces took advantage of the restoration of Soviet democracy\", \"it was all a CIA plan to realise fascism for export to the USSR\" and \"keep calm, loyal Stalinists and supporters of genuine Soviet democracy will restore order\". The Supreme Soviet was isolated, deputies were arrested, and re-elections were announced. A wave of arrests swept through the country, the laws against anti-Sovietism were tightened, and only candidates who had passed the state examinations on dialectics, the basic theses of MELS and political economy were allowed to take part in the new elections. Thus democracy was \"curbed\" and the new government adopted a programme of \"10 new Stalin's blows\": the restoration of self-government of enterprises within the goal of the implementation of planned quotas and state requirements like it was in the Stalin model; the return of monuments and names of Stalin (including the return of the name of Stalingrad to Volgograd); reversal of Khrushchev's rehabilitation of the repressed; organisation of the transfer of power to the Stalinist forces in the socialist countries; creation of a unified CMEA economy; dissolution of the Warsaw Pact organisation with the re-establishment of Cominform; complete break with the Eurocommunist movements; development of a new stage in the development of Marxist theory within the framework of the \"Kosolapov-Popov concept\"; legalisation and expansion of the rights of artels, small businesses and rentiers; as well as the rejection of the \"Policy of Coexistence\" and \"Détente\" and the transition to an active struggle against world Social-Fascism. {0}It is interesting that everything that is happening allowed the newspaper \"Literaturnaya Rossiya\" to publish an interview of Felix Chuev with the old Stalinist Lazar Kaganovich, which ended with the following expression of his: \"Workers, Communists, are you completely blind or something? Where are Stalin's ideas here? You should be shot for such a thing! This is a catastrophe.\"\r\nDespite all Richard Kosolapov's measures to cut off and remove reformists from politics, the people voted mainly for reformist politicians in the last elections. Yet these new \"people's\" reformists campaigned under the name of Stalin and with slogans of restalinisation. However, along with those beautiful slogans, they put forward quite non-Soviet electoral promises: restoration and support for Orthodox practices, abolition of atheism, legalisation of small and medium-sized businesses, privatisation of flats, private media and TV channels, reduction of censorship, and so on. So, such a victory of reformist forces undermined Kosolapov's position in the party completely and he was expelled from the party for \"voluntarism and actions that caused harm to the Soviet power\". On Pribytkov's initiative, Oleg Shenin became General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, criticising \"religiosity, nationalism and derzhavnost'\" but announcing a new CPSU programme - with hopes of outflanking the opposition - which gave limited approval to the ideas of relaxed censorship, independent media and legalisation of small business, together with \"strengthening internationalism, fraternal union of peoples and proletarian culture of new genres and new variety\". At the same time in the Supreme Soviet, in addition to the loyalists of the CPSU Central Committee Politburo and small factions, two large parliamentary blocs were formed, consisting of both low-level CPSU members and non-party self-nominated candidates: Zyuganov-Alksnis's \"Renewed Union\" bloc, which preached the ideas of Christian Orthodox socialism and Abalkin's \"socialist market economy\" economic model; and Pechenyov-Yeltsin's \"Perestroika\" bloc, which took far more radical positions of Russocentrism, Smenovekhovism and the \"French model of dirigisme\". Thus a new Soviet parliamentary tradition was established in the Supreme Soviet, which would continue in the future: a shaky alliance-opposition between the \"orthodox\" of the CPSU, the \"renovationists\" from the ranks of the Soviet \"New Left\" and the \"perestroists\" who attracted people of left-nationalist views. And all this under the shared friendly cheers for Stalin's legacy.{0}It is interesting that everything that is happening allowed the newspaper \"Literaturnaya Rossiya\" to publish an interview of Felix Chuev with the old Stalinist Lazar Kaganovich, which ended with the following expression of his: \"Idiots!

This was to serve as a stimulus for the development of all kinds of enterprises in the country and ultimately to create the conditions for the transition to socialism. During the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, the project was revised: the transition to socialism meant the complete nationalisation of private business, but the guaranteed annual payments to their owners remained, and the former owners themselves were given positions in the new management apparatus of their former enterprises. Now the situation is changing and we have to decide what to do. The first option: leave everything as it is - the former owners will die sooner or later and then the payments will stop, everything will be solved by itself. The second option: recognise the nationalisation of their enterprises as an overstep and return the seized property back to the former owners, returning to the policy of \"socialism through the market\". The third option: reorient policy towards helping small businesses to support the health of our economy. And the fourth option is the easiest: abandon this policy as a relic of the past.\r\nKeep the payments, but not the private property\r\nGive back the property and leave the payouts\r\nSmall businesses need it more\r\nReject this policy\r\nWe're not ready to decide yet\r\nNone of this is necessary\r\nAlready implemented\r\nWe live in a different economy\r\nThe entire party and the entire state apparatus have taken your decision to heart.

An ascetic, devoted CPSU man and one of the participants of the October Revolution, Suslov was known as the man who defined the entire ideology of the USSR for the last 20 years. His ideological leadership was characterised by a tactic of balancing Stalinists and anti-Stalinists, pochvenniks and westerners, and all ideological forces in the SU in an attempt to find a middle ground. There was no second such person in the Politburo of the CPSU - who did not drink, did not smoke, did not even have his own personal furniture, and preferred mashed potatoes and sausages to sturgeon and caviar. For three decades Suslov wore the same coat, until life-loving Brezhnev could not stand it, sniggering at a Politburo meeting: «Why don't we give Misha a new coat?». He surprised everyone even after his death - parsing his papers, it was found that Suslov regularly transferred part of his salary to the Peace Fund. The party's chief ideologist did not boast about it, did not flaunt it, he simply believed that as a Communist it was right for him to do so.| And now the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee will have to decide who will fill the vacated role:\r\n|KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov, who Brezhnev liked for his efficiency and loyalty. But everyone knows that the deceased Suslov disliked Andropov very much and would hardly want him as his successor.\r\n|Brezhnev's old friend and associate Shcherbitsky, which means a major cadre reshuffle, because he will obviously want to move his people from Kiev to Moscow, and this will not suit the current members of the Central Committee.\r\n|Arvid Pelshe is a compromise figure who is unlikely to interfere in the affairs of the Central Committee and allow them to live in peace. But Brezhnev realises that he is ill and therefore wants an active person around him.\r\n|Brezhnev, who was deeply ill, felt that Andropov would be an excellent assistant and could replace Brezhnev in all matters where necessary. As a compromise, Shcherbitsky's man took over as KGB Chairman. However, this already opened up new prospects for Andropov. He had already begun to form a group to study the Hungarian reform experience.\r\n|Despite the resistance of the Central Committee and Andropov, Brezhnev decided that he needed Shcherbitsky here in Moscow, not in Kiev, and the latter, together with his close associates, moved to Moscow.\r\n|Despite Brezhnev's attempts to find an effective successor to Suslov, illness did not allow Leonid Ilyich to cope with this task and, as a compromise figure, the low-initiative and compliant Pelshe was appointed \"interim\" until Brezhnev's death, which was already seen by all as a short-term affair.\r\n<color=yellow>Army Strength: {1}</color>|Growth: {2}|<color=fuchsia>The growth of the army depends on contributions to the army and on the level of development of Industry</color>\r\n<color=yellow>Combat Units: {1}</color>|Growth: {2}|<color=yellow>Reservists: {3}</color>|<color=fuchsia>Growth depends on population growth</color>\r\n<color=yellow>Navy Strength: {1}</color>|<color=fuchsia>Navy strength is converted manually from the strength of the army and combat units</color>\r\n<color=lime>Cost of +50.0 Navy Strength:</color>|<color=red>-50.0 Army Strength|-1.0 Combat Units|-25.0 from the budget</color>\r\n<color=red>Return for -1.0 Navy Strength:</color>|<color=lime>+5.0 Army Strength|+1.0 Combat Units</color>\r\nVietnam\r\nIndia\r\nJapan\r\nVietnam\r\nLaos\r\nKampuchea\r\nThailand\r\nThailand\r\nMyanmar\r\nUSSR\r\nUSSR\r\nSingapore\r\nAfghanistan\r\nNepal\r\nPhilippines\r\nPhilippines\r\nDPRK\r\nPusto\r\nPusto\r\nPusto\r\n<color=purple>Preemptive Defensive War{0}to neutralise Vietnam</color>\r\n<color=purple>Preemptive War of Liberation{0}to restore territorial integrity</color>\r\n<color=teal>Third Naval Invasion{0} for the conquest and integration of Japan</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive War of Liberation{0}to seize and integrate Vietnam</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive War of Liberation{0}to seize and integrate Laos</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive War of Liberation{0}to seize and integrate Kampuchea</color>\r\n<color=purple>Preemptive War of Defence{0}for the subjugation of Thailand</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive War of Liberation{0}to seize and integrate Thailand</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive Liberation War{0}to seize and integrate Myanmar</color>\r\n<color=purple>Special Military Operation{0}to return Uighur refugees</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive Liberation War{0}to seize and integrate Black Dragon Island</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive War of Liberation{0}to seize and integrate Dan Ma Xi</color>\r\n<color=purple>Special military operation{0}to eliminate drug trafficking to China</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive Liberation War{0}to seize and integrate Nepal and Bhutan</color>\r\n<color=purple>Preemptive War of Defence{0}for the subjugation of the Philippines</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive Defensive War {0}to control Nánshā Qúndǎo (Spratlys)</color>\r\n<color=teal>Preemptive Liberation War{0}to seize and integrate DPRK</color>\r\n<color=purple>The second Daman conflict</color>\r\nPusto\r\nPusto\r\nKorea is united & together with the Philippines in our military alliance\r\nFleet strength is 500.0 and there are no other direct wars\r\nThere is no war.\r\nPreemptive Defensive War with Vietnam\r\nWar to restore territorial integrity with India\r\nThird Invasion in Japan\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with Vietnam\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with Laos\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with Kampuchea\r\nPreemptive Defence War with Thailand\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with Thailand\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with Myanmar\r\nBorder conflict with the USSR in Middle Asia\r\nWar for control of Sakhalin\r\nPreemptive Liberation War for Danmashi\r\nSpecial operation against drug trafficking\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with Nepal and Bhutan\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with the Philippines\r\nWar for Oceanic Resources with the Philippines\r\nPreemptive Liberation War with DPRK\r\nThe second Daman conflict\r\nPusto\r\nPusto\r\n<color=orange>Conflict Victory Progress:</color>|Every 2 weeks:|<color=red> -5.0% to progress|-0.1 to population.|Defeat at 0.0% progress</color>|<color=lime>Victory at 100.0% progress</color>|<color=yellow>A victory returns 90% of combat units,|and a defeat returns 70% of combat units</color>\r\n<color=lime>Cost of +5.0 conflict progress:</color>|<color=red>The cost depends on the military tactics chosen and the humanitarian tactics chosen.</color>\r\n<color=red>Return for -1.5 Conflict Progress:</color>|<color=lime>+0.5 Army Strength|+0.1 Combat Units</color>\r\nThere was an opportunity to start this war\r\nArmy Strength -

In place of the disparate peoples and nations of East Asia, a completely new unified federation of many countries was formed, which is now boldly marching into a great future under the leadership of Beijing and a single flag of joint development and prosperity. Borders are being erased, economies are being united, a common citizenship is being introduced and finally a new and largest nation in the world is emerging on the international stage.\r\nThe centuries-old legend of Chinese statehood was able to re-emerge on the world stage: China has once again become a unifying force for a multitude of nations in the struggle for a brighter future. The new federation has shown a possible alternative path for the countries of Asia and will probably welcome other members in the future. In the meantime, cartographers are once again forced to redraw all the maps of the world, but is that a bad thing?!\r\nNo unified federation has been able to gain a foothold in East Asia, leaving the region in fracture and multi-vectorism.\r\nSakhalin - the birthplace of elephants\r\nThe defeat of the Soviet army in Central Asia and the forced extradition of runaway Uighurs led to a dramatic increase in the influence of the military in the Soviet Union. Thus in 1987, after the infamous flight of Matthias Rust, the military was too powerful to be simply ousted by an unspoken resolution. So the ‘architect of Perestroika’ Yakovlev designed a new plan to dismantle Soviet regime in a different way. At his instigation and advice, Gorbachev blamed the entire Soviet government for the flight of Matthias Rust: Gorbachev declared that the entire Soviet top brass was to blame for the incident. Mikhail Sergeyevich became the first ruler of the USSR to publicly recognise that the country had huge, complex problems that required only fundamental reforms. And then he dissolved the Council of Ministers, and together with the entire Politburo he resigned, meaning the complete withdrawal from politics of both the members of the Politburo and the members of the Council of Ministers. Yakovlev's hope to create a power vacuum in the USSR in this way and push it into a crisis, the consequence of which would be fundamental deep reforms, however, did not pay off. Yes, the disclosure of the problems and the recognition of their enormity by the General Secretary himself undermined stability in Soviet society, and the resignation of the Politburo and Council of Ministers created a temporary power vacuum and disarray, but then an urgent congress of the CPSU, organised on an emergency basis with the support of the KGB and army apparatuses, elected a new Politburo made up of ‘old’ reformists and those Andropov cadres who had previously occupied second roles to the Gorbachev and Ligachev groups. Yes, both were Andropov's nominees, but for their vivacity and activity, Andropov personally and the Politburo of the 1980s as a whole had previously favoured and promoted precisely those groups of ‘Andropovites’ gathered around Gorbachev and Ligachev. |A compromise candidate was elected as the new General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee: an outstanding economist and Masherov's colleague in the moderate reforms in the Belarusian SSR its head Nikolai Slyunkov (under him even queues in shops disappeared in the BSSR). |The Council of Ministers was headed by the pragmatic and quiet technocrat Vladimir Dolgikh, and his deputy was the staunch economic reformer Yuri Solovyov, both of whom initiated reforms in line with the massive development of joint ventures with foreign corporations and a return to the old principles of the NEP, while maintaining state monopoly over strategic, financial and raw materials sectors, as well as foreign trade. |The Economic Department of the Central Committee was headed by Viktor Nikonov, author of a radical reform in agriculture from collective and state farms to family contract farming and cooperative farming, which the whole department plans to implement.| The Foreign Ministry was headed by Yevgeny Primakov, who began a new round of confrontation with the US, but with a pragmatic course of cooperation against NATO with all countries of the world, regardless of their ideology. |The Gosplan was headed by Alexandra Biryukova, secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, an engineer and a labour enthusiast, who took a firm hand in bringing order to the consumer sphere and hammered out fundamental reforms in the Gosplan, in particular the five-year plan's bias towards consumer goods and light industry. |And Boris Pugo, head of Latvia and Latvian by nationality, became Minister of Internal Affairs, who began a massive crackdown on nationalist, liberal and separatist organisations and groups.|All in all, the USSR pursues a series of reforms, hoping to emerge from its foreign and domestic political collapse and return to the world stage as a superpower.\r\nThe defeat of the Soviet army in Central Asia and the loss of Sakhalin during the blockade organised by the Sino-Japanese navy, as well as the total loss of the Far Eastern fleet, led to a dramatic increase in the influence of the military in the Soviet Union. Thus in 1987, after the infamous flight of Matthias Rust, the military was too powerful to simply agree to resign en masse after being criticised by Gorbachev. On the contrary, in an attempt to send the military into retirement, the military, backed by Vladimir Medvedev, the chief of security for the General Secretary, decide to stage a coup d'état, considering the civilian leadership responsible for all the defeats. They arrest the entire Politburo and the Council of Ministers and set up the GKChP, accusing the current authorities of working for the West and deliberately destroying the economy and military sector to bring down the country and further privatise it into the hands of the party ‘elite’.| The GKChP was led by Ustinov's closest associate, the Minister of Defence, Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei Sokolov. The GKChP also included both military and civilian personnel associated with military structures, in particular Chief Marshal of Aviation Alexander Koldunov, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei Akhromeev, Marshal of Aviation Ivan Pstygo, Marshal of Aviation Anatoly Konstantinov, Marshal of Aviation Ivan Kozhedub, Head of the USSR Ministry of Defence Control Group in Afghanistan and Chernobyl veteran Valentin Varennikov, Commander of the Transcaucasian Military District Konstantin Kochetov, 1st Secretary of the CPU Central Committee Vladimir Shcherbitsky, 1st Secretary of the CPUz Central Committee Inamjon Usmankhodjaev, 1st Secretary of the Turkmenistan CP Central Committee Saparmurat Niyazov, 1st Secretary of the Latvian CP Central Committee Boris Pugo, Director of GIPKh, Chernobyl chemist and one of the main designers of Energia-Buran Boris Gidaspov, and cybernetic programmer and international scientist Anatoly Kitov. |All political liberalisation was curtailed, and disaffected young dissident groups were dispersed by loyal army units. Instead of Glasnost and Perestroika, mass restalinisation and renaming of cities began. Similarly, Gorbachev's economic reforms were curtailed, then the leadership of the country responsible for the 1983-1987 reforms were exemplarily shot, and a Songun analogue was introduced in the country: the military was given power in the field and in economic structures, corruption began to be executed even in cases of petty embezzlement, the Gosplan was completely reoriented towards militarisation and the military-industrial complex, and mass militarisation of the country began. At the same time, however, in order to increase the efficiency of the management of the country and the economy, mass computerisation and automation of all spheres of the economy and society began, as Ustinov had once wanted.| Meanwhile, in foreign policy, Kazimierz Mijal and Bela Bisku in Poland and Hungary, unexpectedly for their friends in China, happily accepted ‘the destruction of counter-revolutionaries and the return to Stalin's rule in the USSR’ and quickly became loyal friends of Moscow again, causing China to lose all its influence on them. Then the combined forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organisation were brought to the borders of Romania under the guise of exercises, an ultimatum was secretly sent to restore the Soviet base, and after the expected rejection from Ceausescu, a Hungarian uprising began in Romania, leading to the coup d'état of the tandem of Gheorghe Apostol and Nicolae Militaru. The new Romanian authorities, supported by the USSR, ended the austerity regime and re-established a Soviet military base. The WTO bloc became fully loyal to Moscow, and it seems that this is only the beginning....\r\nSakhalin was, is and will be Soviet!\r\nDestiny of {0}\r\nThe country was not taken as part of the federation.\r\nAfter Myanmar's liberation, it was headed by Dr Maung Maung, a quiet lawyer who took part in the drafting of Myanmar's 1974 Constitution, becoming Minister of Justice by 1980. Despite his involvement in the Central Committee of the ruling Burmese Socialist Party, the Chinese liberators decided to use his old connections to avoid destroying the entire apparatus of the country and to reduce the number of guerrilla military units.|The new civilian president of Myanmar federalised the country, extending autonomy to all regions and facilitating the rise of pro-Chinese politicians to power in them. Nevertheless, by maintaining martial law and the authority of armed units throughout the country, Maung Maung facilitated the integration of Myanmar into the new unified federation with a firm hand and brute force.\r\nAfter Myanmar's liberation, it was led by Comrade Poe Changchong, a revolutionary, poet and mid-level figure of the underground pro-China Communist Party of Burma. After the liberation of Myanmar by China, it became clear that some of the top members of the CPB were not authoritative in the party, another part was involved in the opium trade, and a third had a disagreement with the idea of Burma joining a united Federation with China. The consequence of this was a policy of rectification, during which both the party and the country were led by Comrade Po Than Gyaung.|The new communist leader organised a NEP in the country - nationalising all business and establishing party rule in the cities, but distributing land in the countryside to peasants and farmers as ‘feudal Burma was not yet ready for socialism’. At the same time, the country underwent relative federalisation, with Burma's own limited autonomies. Thus red Burma followed a new path, which, however, leads to unification with China in one way or another.\r\nAfter the liberation of Myanmar, it was headed by Htin Kyaw, the deputy director of the Foreign Economic Relations Department of the old regime. It was his service in the foreign economic department that allowed this politician to achieve flexibility and pragmatism, and his experience and connections conclusively made him the best candidate for Beijing's support. Having received the assistance provided with the support of the liberators, Thin Kyaw formed his own party called the Democratic League.|The newly elected leader came to power and introduced a series of reforms to democratise the state and liberalise the economy, as well as lustrating many figures from the previous regime. The new Burmese constitution enshrined multi-party democracy and private business, and guaranteed social rights, dirigisme and the broad participation of trade union organisations in society. Such social democratic policies, together with a mixed economy and populism, enabled the new Burma to realise a quiet integration into the new federation with China through multiculturalism and a socially oriented market.\r\nAfter Myanmar's liberation, it was headed by Colonel Kim Maung, an old military man and dissident who opposed the power of the military and favoured civilian rule, for which he sat in repeated arrest. After the liberation of Myanmar by China, with the support of Beijing, the colonel formed his own National Liberal Party, after which, thanks to his eloquence and populism, he successfully won the first general election with his party.|The newly elected leader came to power and introduced a series of reforms to democratise the state and liberalise the economy, as well as lustrating many figures from the past regime. The new Burmese constitution enshrined multi-party democracy and private business, and guaranteed the supremacy of traditional values, Buddhism and conservatism. Such national-conservative policies, together with deregulation and decentralisation of the economy, enabled the new Burma to realise a smooth integration into the new federation with China through conservative democracy and a social-conservative economy.\r\nAfter Thailand's liberation, it was headed by Anand Panyarachun, a former foreign minister, businessman and bank director. He had previously been a strong advocate of building relations with China, which was one of the main reasons for his appointment by the liberators, other reasons being his pliability, flexibility and incorruptibility.|The new head of the Thai military junta quickly put the government back on track and cracked down on insurgent activists with a programme of integration into a unified federation with China. However, he was not a quiet puppet and criticised the military junta with which he ruled. Thus, Anand Panyarachun introduced a reform of the country's decentralisation, deregulation of the economy, courts and law enforcement agencies. While the military, under the guise of fighting insurgents and terrorists, eliminated any opposition, the country saw a significant reduction in corruption and increased economic stability. Further integration of Thailand, however, at the request of Anand Panyarachun was accompanied by the introduction of multi-party politics and free elections, although only conservative pro-Chinese parties and organisations were allowed to participate.\r\nAfter Thailand's liberation, it was led by Comrade Pracha Thanyapaiboon, a rather adaptable activist and leader of the Communist Party of Thailand, long and firmly allied with China. Under his administration, free elections were held in Thailand, but only the socialist parties - Social Democratic, Labour, Socialist and Communist Parties - were allowed to participate.|Once in power, the Communists carried out a massive collectivisation of agriculture and divided the entire country into self-governing communes run by party cells. Opposition parties - all three of which had been elected to parliament with the Communists - who disagreed with the loss of Thai sovereignty and its integration into a single federation with China, staged strikes and industrial action in the cities, which resulted in their being banned and their leaders arrested. From the remnants of the loyal parts of these parties, the People's Democratic Party was formed, which was given the regulation of the urban areas, while most of the country - the rural regions - were taken over by the Communists. However, there are too few differences between the two parties, and they are both loyal to Beijing and keen to implement its policies.\r\nAfter the liberation of Thailand, it was headed by Suthep Sutchakhun - the leader of the small Social Democratic Party of Thailand, speaking from the position of Buddhist-Christian socialism, without Marxism and Maoism.|Coming to power, in addition to integrating Thailand into a federation with China, Suthep Sutchakhun dissolved all parties and introduced a non-partisan self-governing democracy of decentralised communes with special rights of labour collectives and social guarantees. The supreme body of the country became the annually convened assembly, which, however, could no longer prevent the massive penetration of Chinese goods and workers into Thailand, thus being absorbed by Beijing. Thai society itself, under the guidance of the new leader's supporters, moved towards co-operative agrarianism and a pious way of life.\r\nAfter Thailand's liberation, it was led by Krasae Chanawongse, an economist, academic, and political Buddhist activist. Under the treaty with Beijing, Thailand retained a limited monarchy, but Thailand began to actively integrate into a unified federation with China.|Under the new leader's leadership, the country underwent massive democratisation and deregulation, and as Thailand's economy integrated with China's, so did massive liberalisation. In the first free elections, Krasae Chanawongse won a landslide victory, founding the centre-left New Force Party. Continuing on the course of preserving the traditional monarchy and Buddhism and integrating with China, the new government began to implement social programmes and reforms, aiming to build a prosperous economy and population on the position of free capitalism with equal conditions for all.\r\nAfter the liberation of Laos, it was led by Pa Kao Her, a rebel commander and self-proclaimed king of the Hmong, one of the nationalities of Laos. Once in power, he immediately organised mass executions and his own coronation, thus becoming King of Laos despite the protests of the exiled royal family.|The new King began to integrate Laos into a federation with China as zealously as he did to impose radical Buddhism: power was transferred to the new Hmong aristocrats, education was handed over to monasteries, an official religion was established, and the entire economy was placed in the hands of the state and managed by a decentralised system of appointed governors. World analysts debate whether the neo-royalist regime, backed by millions of Chinese bayonets, pushed Laos' development back a hundred years or whether a new hybrid regime characteristic of the region was established.\r\nAfter the liberation of Laos, it was led by Pany Yathotou, a quiet, active and efficient economist, banker at the Lao Foreign Economic Bank and director of the planning committee. This was exactly the kind of person Beijing needed to stably implement the project of integrating Laos into a unified federation with China.|Steadily following the established line, Pany Yathotou in fact became the leader of one of China's economic regions, skilfully managing and stabilising the economy of Laos, thus reassuring the people and easing the transitional period of Laos' integration.\r\nAfter the liberation of Laos, it was led by Kong Le, one of the founders of the Lao anti-American Neutralist movement, a rebel commander who fought against both royalists and communists. He spent several years trying to get the Chinese government to intervene in Laos and liberate it, and seems to have finally succeeded.|Blessed by Chinese aid, the idealistic Kong Le began to implement a policy of democratisation and liberalisation of the political regime, along with the transformation of the economy to the Birdcage model, with a particular emphasis on rural development. Continuing the integration of Laos into a single federation with China comes with the actual realisation of the third way ideas of the Lao civil war of the past.\r\nAfter the liberation of Laos, it was led by Vang Pao, a controversial figure in the Lao anti-communist insurgency. Notably, he not only led the rebels, but also developed his own business with money from donations from high-ranking refugees and aristocratic Lao families.|When Vang Pao came to power as part of a pact with China, he quickly moved his assets and business to Laos, where he effectively took over the entire economy into the hands of his own corporation, creating only a façade of democracy. Although parties such as the Democratic Party with liberal leanings and the National Progressive Party with conservative tendencies were established in the country, in reality all major and medium-sized posts and positions were distributed to those who had previously bought special securities from Vang Pao himself, for which the corresponding positions were given. Thus, the power of the Vang Pao Corporation was established in the country, and Laos itself became just one of the corporations operating in the actually new territory of China.\r\nAfter the liberation of Vietnam, it was led by Ha Thuc Ky, an activist of the Nationalist Revolutionary Party of Greater Vietnam with legalist views. Among all high-ranking political refugees of this party, he was chosen by Beijing as the most flexible and contractual person. His first task was to re-establish the party on the ground in Vietnam.|When Ha Thuc Ky came to power, he began to implement the limited moderate programme of his party, drawn up by founder Truong Tu Anh: class solidarity, state dictatorship, sovereign democracy, extreme individualism and sexual revolution were declared the main priorities of the Vietnamese statehood. The state took control of all important spheres of economy, destroyed trade unions and implemented a broad social welfare programme. At the same time the cult of labour with 12-hour shifts, the cult of family with compulsory many children and the cult of loyalty to the state began to spread, and for violation of any of three principles fines and even labour colony are imposed. At the same time, despite the facade of democracy and justice, all power became concentrated in the hands of ‘national revolutionary leaders’, and the economy and politics were integrated into a single federative sphere with China.\r\nAfter Vietnam's liberation, it was led by Le Trong Nghia, a disgraced figure of the Vietnamese Communist Party, capable of flexible diplomatic thinking and the ability to successfully negotiate even with the Japanese occupiers during World War II. At the behest of Beijing, he first reorganised the Communist Party to meet the needs of the new policy and new conditions.|Once in power, Le Trong Nghia first rehabilitated and restored the honour of the so-called ‘Anti-Party Revisionist Group’, although he did not allow them to return to power in any way. He then announced the beginning of the policy of ‘Renewal’: unions were liberated, the rights of labour collectives were expanded, the courts were democratised and pluralism of opinion within the party was expanded. Along with this, imperceptibly to the public eye, Vietnam's economy and politics begin a gradual integration into a unified federation with China. Le Trong Nghia got his dream of a democratic people's Vietnam and China got theirs.\r\nAfter Vietnam's liberation, it was led by Hoang Minh Chính, a disgraced dissident and former general secretary of the Democratic Party of Vietnam, which had been an ally of the Communists until the 60s, but then it was split over foreign policy, democratisation and Trotskyism. Returning from house arrest with the support of Beijing, Hoang Minh Chính reorganised the Democratic Party from its right and liberal wings.|Once in power, Hoang Minh Chính banned the Communist Party of Vietnam and communist literature, rehabilitated members of the ‘Anti-Party Revisionist Group’ and established a new Constitution proclaiming freedom, human rights, private business, multi-partyism and democracy, after which hundreds of political parties and organisations formed in the country. There was no privatisation, but instead the market was de-regulated and Chinese banks and businesses were allowed in. The established parliamentary republic with a nominal President and dozens of parties in parliament allowed China to control enough of the parliament and economy to bring Vietnam under Chinese currency and realise its gradual integration into a single federation with China.\r\nAfter Vietnam's liberation, it was led by Vu Hong Khanh, a previously arrested by Communists former commander and activist of the Vietnamese National Party, an ally of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War. Despite his longstanding assistance to the Kuomintang he had no connection with their politicians, and, moreover, being under 20-year house arrest in Vietnam he became an excellent option for Beijing, having lost all his connections and influence.|When Vu Hong Khanh came to power he was mainly engaged in speeches and writing a new Constitution, and all power in the country was concentrated in the hands of young cadres of the Communist Party of Vietnam, who defected to China and became the head of the reorganised Vietnamese National Party. The new Constitution proclaimed freedom, human rights, private business, multi-partyism and democracy. Privatised enterprises largely went to Chinese owners and land was redistributed to private Vietnamese farmers. Basic social guarantees were maintained, but many communist laws and projects were dismantled. Despite this, thanks to huge financial and political aid, the reorganised pro-Chinese Vietnamese National Party, which pursued a policy of integrating Vietnam into a single federation with China, started to hold the majority of seats in the elections. \r\nAfter the liberation of Kampuchea, it was led by Ieng Sary, the ‘No. 3 brother’ of the Khmer Rouge, who was wise enough to win Beijing's loyalty and allegiance first. Officially, he announced his break with the ‘fascist regime of Pol Pot’ and accused his former associates of brutal terror and massacres.|When he came to power, Ieng Sary formed the formally conservative-democratic party Democratic National Union Movement, but in fact established a one-party regime, persecuting all opposition. The country officially turned into a raw material colony of China, the economy began to develop exclusively raw material spheres with massive extraction of natural resources (in particular, diamonds and wood), a considerable share of profits from which went into the hands of the ruling clique of Kampuchea. At the same time, the radical establishment of Buddhism and eradication (often even physically) of representatives of other religions in society with the destruction of their temples and holy places began. Overall, while integrating into a unified federation with China, the lives of ordinary Kampucheans did not improve much.\r\nAfter the liberation of Kampuchea, it was led by Pen Sovan, a disgraced pro-Vietnam communist and one of the founders of the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party. He was expelled from the party and sent to prison by his Vietnamese supervisor as a revisionist for his excessive orthodoxy and refusal to compromise on policy.|Once in power, Pen Sovan formed the Communist Party of Kampuchea from some former Khmer and pro-Vietnamese communists, establishing a one-party republic. Under his orders, the entire economy was nationalised and subordinated to the party-economic apparatus under central planning, collective farms were organised and a broad social assistance programme was implemented. At the same time, a large part of Phnom Penh's population was evicted to the countryside without the right to return ‘for collaboration with the Khmer Rouge fascists and Vietnamese occupiers’. Phnom Penh was repopulated by Loyalists and Chinese settlers, thus cementing Kampuchea's transition into a unified federation with China.\r\nAfter the liberation of Kampuchea, it was led by Hun Sen, a former active commander of both the Khmer Rouge and pro-Vietnam Communists. A highly flexible and idea-less man, he readily agreed to cooperate with China in exchange for financial preferences and quickly organised the Cambodian People's Party from small Communist, Khmer Rouge and National Conservative figures.|Despite the formally declared multi-party system, most of the parliament, with Chinese support, went to the ruling party while the Royalist opposition was once again crushed. Only the small liberal and social democratic parties formed a separate - and safe for the regime - opposition in parliament. In the economy, the gradual transfer of enterprises and farms into Chinese hands through their reorganisation into joint stock companies began, Chinese currency was adopted, and banks were subordinated to the Chinese Central Bank. At the same time, private business and foreign enterprises were legalised in Kampuchea with low taxes and good loan terms, thus creating a network of small-scale handicraft workshops, allowing the local people to provide for their own welfare.\r\nAfter the liberation of Kampuchea, it was led by the tandem of Prince Norodom Ranariddh and ‘Brother No. 5’ Khieu Samphan - who were able to negotiate and compromise after the defeat of Pol Pot and pro-Vietnam forces. Norodom Ranariddh was crowned King of Cambodia, prompting protests from the legitimate reigning king. And Khieu Samphan became prime minister, forming the formally social-liberal Khmer National Solidarity Party.|While Norodom Ranarith sought to attract investment from China and neighbouring countries to build a nuclear power plant and transform the country into a resort area, Khieu Samphan focused on diamonds mines and woods factories, as well as opium plantations, thereby damaging resort areas and nature, and massively forcibly evicting traditional settlements that stood in the way of his plans. Eventually King Norodom Ranariddh formed his own Norodom Ranariddh Party and began to criticise the government's actions. Thus the royalty and the government clashed, but were unable to use the army to resolve the conflict, as Kampuchea had no independent army left and even the guerrilla units had been disbanded long ago. The established dual power allowed Beijing to successfully implement the policy of integrating Kampuchea into a single federation with China.\r\nDeclared occupiers by the Japanese people, the Chinese leaders did not dare to destroy the Japanese monarchy, but resorted to finding a suitable loyal scion of the Japanese ruling dynasty for their plans, seeking to strengthen the Japanese monarchy to restore their image in the eyes of ordinary Japanese people.|{0}\r\nThe one who persuaded Emperor Hirohito to abdicate after another defeat was his brother Mikasa-no-miya Takahito. Through negotiations with Beijing, he was also crowned, and according to his own vow, ‘upon my death, the succession will pass to Crown Prince Naruhito’, Hirohito's grandson. Once in power, however, Takahito shocked Japanese society and the international community by publishing his own World War II reports, which revealed genocide, civilian abuse and rape of Chinese by Japanese soldiers, as well as a cover-up by Japanese officers and Manchu leaders. As part of the lustration announced against this backdrop, the vast majority of politicians were arrested, many parties were banned, and the military apparatus was purged to the ground. During this, a temporary, unlimited state of emergency was imposed in Japan.|The new Japanese Emperor Takahito then declared that ‘only the study of Judaism has helped me feel proud of Japan again’ and declared that ‘truth is contained in Judaism’ and ‘Judaism is a sacred bridge’, before openly embracing this religion and promoting the mass opening of Jewish temples, schools and academies throughout the country. Subsequently, the Emperor repented for all the sins of the Japanese on live television and supported Japan's full involvement in ‘friendship and unity with China within a federation’, dealing mainly with investigations into World War II atrocities and promoting Judaism while Chinese leaders gradually integrated Japan.\r\nUnder pressure from the Chinese army, Emperor Hirohito decided to abdicate his eldest son Akihito in favour of his younger son Hitachi-no-miya Masahito. But his younger son was mostly a notable scientist developing vaccines and medicines, and chose to hand over control to his left-wing political party advisers. In further proceedings, most politicians and parties were banned for participating in or covering up war crimes during World War II. A ruling National Front coalition of the Communist Party, Socialist Party and Japanese Revolutionary Communist League was then formed.|The new government adopted the principles of democratic centralism, reformism and trade unionism, nationalising all corporations and large enterprises but leaving small businesses intact. The country adopted a planned economy with an extensive role for trade unions, and cancelled all borders and restrictions with China, marking a gradual integration into a unified federation.\r\nUnder pressure from the Chinese army, Emperor Hirohito decided to abdicate his eldest son Akihito in favour of his direct-line grandson, Hiro-no-miya Naruhito. After coming to power, the young Emperor, with the support of Chinese friends, began to crush corporations and mafia, to go out to the people more often, to fight against traditions and the closure of Japanese society, to support ecology and water conservation. In one of his meetings with the masses, he was even injured, after which Chinese forces launched a punitive action and openly seized the property and businesses of the corporations and mafia into the hands of the Chinese government.| By reforming and opening up society, Naruhito also contributed to improving prosperity, increasing the birth rate, and reducing depression and suicide in Japan, making himself into history as ‘the most people's Emperor’. By then, however, practically the entire Japanese economy had already been taken over by China, marking its successful integration into a unified federation.\r\nThe one who persuaded Emperor Hirohito to abdicate after another defeat was his brother Mikasa-no-miya Takahito, who also recommended changing the law of succession and passing the throne to a new branch of the imperial family not tainted by constant defeats, namely Hirohito's nephew Takamado-no-miya Norihito. Having come to power and received support from China, the new emperor actively engaged in eradicating corruption and mafia in the country. Many politicians were imprisoned, many members of the mafia were killed in numerous ‘Clean Hands’ operations, and the property seized from corporations was divided into parts and privatised into the hands of various owners.|As a result, through the force of violence and the support of China, Japan experienced a new flowering of democracy, freedoms and human rights, finally cleansed of mafia structures in the government and economy. However, their place was taken by Chinese ‘friends’, agents and entrepreneurs, marking Japan's transition not only to a true liberal democracy, but also to a unity in a new federation with Beijing.\r\nAlign\r\nAlign to the unified order (change their State system)\r\nKhmer Remarkable\r\nThe Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975 and have since become China's active allies in the struggle for dominance in Southeast Asia. It was only a year after the regime was established, but the ruling party itself had already split. Two groups with different views on further reforms in Kampuchea have emerged in the leading core: the left wing, consisting of Hu Nim, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, opposes the ideas of the central wing, led by Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Son Sen, which consist in total collectivisation of all spheres in the country and dividing it into communes. At the moment, the political struggle has entered an active phase and the next month will be decisive in the confrontation between the two factions. However, maybe we should take advantage of this strife and destroy this point of instability in the region with the help of our brave liberation army...?\r\nSupport the centre wing\r\nSupport the left wing\r\nNow is the best time to attack the Khmer revisionists!\r\nIn the course of the political struggle, Pol Pot decided to implement a stratagem and take the brunt of the attack off himself. From 27 September to 25 October 1976, he was Prime Minister of Kampuchea for a month due to Pol Pot's ‘illness’ (in reality, there was a factional struggle which Pol Pot won and in which Nuon Chea remained his staunch ally). However, at the end of the ‘illness’, the left wing of the party had already been defeated, and one of its members, Khieu Samphan, even defected to Pol Pot, betraying his old associates. Formally, no one was deprived of their posts, ranks or awards, but as a result of the struggle, the ideas of the centre wing were accepted for implementation, while their opponents lost all political influence. Kampuchea began its transformation into a system of super-collectivised communes.\r\nIn the course of the political struggle Pol Pot decided to implement a cunning and remove the main blow from himself by announcing his ‘illness’, however, under our pressure from 7 September 1976, within a month, Khieu Samphan, the most agreementable of the left wing, was appointed interim Prime Minister of Kampuchea. Having realised whose side the full might of China stood behind, Khieu remained loyal to the left wing of the party and, with its support, Pol Pot was isolated and sent for indefinite ‘treatment’. In October, the centre wing was finally defeated and left wing leader Hu Nim became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kampuchea. A party-led planned economy was established in the cities, while in the countryside independent co-operatives were formed, operating on the market principle, ‘as Kampuchea had only recently been a feudal country and was not yet ready for full socialism’. Private property, however, had already been abolished.\r\nHaving realised that Kampuchea in its current form was the main destabilising factor in the region and that the only way to solve this problem was to create a puppet regime in it, our intelligence services got in touch with individual commanders, whether loyal to us or simply fond of power or money, and organised an uprising in the rear of Kampuchea right at the time of Pol Pot's tactical withdrawal ‘due to illness’ for medical treatment. The stunned fragmented ruling group did not react in time to the events, moreover, some of the top party cadres even defected to the rebels when they took over the ports and the PLA began to land there.\r\nThe country is not in alliances and there was an event on the proclamation of Juche in the DPRK\r\n<color=yellow>Focus on massive assaults</color>|There is nothing better than overwhelming the enemy with multiple numbers of manpower.|<color=cyan>Cost of +5.0 conflict progress:</color>|<color=red>-2.5 Army Strength|-5.0 Combat Units</color>\r\n<color=yellow>Focus on weapon strength</color>|The best attack is one made on empty trenches, and our artillery and snipers will certainly ensure that.|<color=cyan>Cost of +5.0 Conflict Progress:</color>|<color=red>-7.5 Army Strength|-0.5 Combat Units</color>\r\n<color=yellow>Focus on chemical weapons</color>|Let the enemy die in agony so we can teach them to fear while reducing our losses.|<color=cyan>Cost of +5.0 conflict progress:</color>|<color=red>-2.5 Army Strength|-0.5 Combat Units|-0.5 Popular Support|+0.5 Liberalisation of Minds|-0.5 Party Support|-2.5 Relations with the US and USSR</color>\r\n<color=yellow>Humane treatment</color>|We can win the support of the liberated masses only by caring for them.|<color=cyan>To the cost of the conflict's progress:</color>|<color=red>-0.5 from the budget</color>\r\n<color=yellow>Scraps for the defeated</color>|Victory on the battlefield is our primary concern, and care for the liberated villages is secondary.|<color=cyan>To the cost of the conflict's progress:</color>|<color=red>-0.5 Popular support|+0.5 Liberalisation of minds</color>\r\n<color=yellow>Eradicate the Dissenters</color>|There are many enemies lurking among the liberated villages, they must be dealt with and secured.|<color=cyan>To the cost of conflict progress:</color>|<color=lime>+0.5 Party Support|+0.1 Unity</color>|<color=red>-0.5 Popular Support|+0.5 Liberalisation of Minds|-0.5 Agent Network</color>\r\nDemand, through threats of force, the transfer of control over the Diaoyu Islands\r\nNegotiate joint ownership and administration of the Diaoyu Islands\r\nJapan is socialist or a puppet of ours\r\nJapan is in China's sphere of influence\r\nJapan is socialist/reformist or a puppet of ours\r\nJapan is in China's sphere of influence or military alliance\r\nDiaoyu is Japanese\r\nWithdraw\r\nSecretly\r\nWithdraw money directly from our account:{0}10 to the budget for 10 from the account\r\nWithdraw money secretly from our account:{0}5 to the budget for 10 from the account\r\nOur Swiss accounts are not frozen\r\nThere is money in Swiss accounts.\r\nWithdrew no more than 25% this month\r\n<color=#00DA1D>Active</color>\r\n<color=#DC143C>Frozen</color>\r\nProclaim the supremacy of the Red Gene\r\nWhy did these particular Chinese great revolutionaries were able to lead the country to greatness, and not others? It is all about the ‘red gene’ that was in these people from birth, was in their ancestors and will be passed in their heirs. It is the carriers of the red genes who have such outstanding qualities to serve as the vanguards of the entire Chinese people. All that remains is to consolidate these theses in schools, party programme and state position.\r\nRed Gene activation\r\nAs a result of the pivotal decision, the Chinese authorities officially adopted the ‘red gene’ theory as the cornerstone of the future course of the party and state. This theory, which emphasises the inherited revolutionary spirit and devotion to the cause of communism, has now become the guiding principle of governance and organisation of society.|While the rhetoric of democratic principles and people power continues, in reality the situation on the ground indicates the development of a different new political situation: the descendants of the early Chinese revolutionaries have risen to a privileged position, forming a new aristocracy that wields considerable power and influence over the political and economic life of the country.|As the ‘red gene’ theory has developed, its implications have become more far-reaching: the new elite, bound by hereditary transmission of power, now controls key levers of the state apparatus, from policy-making and military command to cultural and educational institutions. The era of egalitarian ideals seems to be giving way to a structured hierarchy based on lineage and historical allegiance.|In this new chapter of China's evolution, the country's citizens find themselves in a situation where the ideals of the past are being altered by an ossified political elite, and the true essence of people's power is becoming a matter of reflection and debate.|The future of the country will depend on the balance between the ‘new revolutionary ideals’ and the needs and aspirations of the general public.\r\nActivation did not occur.\r\nPan-World Picnic\r\nAs the sun sets over a world reshaped by ambition and ideology, the final chapter of this grand political odyssey unfolds. The once divergent paths of old aristocratic traditions and revolutionary fervor have converged into a singular, powerful entity. Through the strategic vision of the Chinese authorities and the innovative approach of the Austrian \"Pan-European Picnic\" organization, a new force has emerged on the global stage.|This entity, the International Alliance of Red Gene Supporters, now stands as a beacon of a new era. Here, ancient nobility mingles seamlessly with the fervor of modern revolutionary ideals, crafting a unique fusion of red elitism. This movement transcends borders, infusing historical grandeur with contemporary zeal, forging a sophisticated and influential network that reshapes the ideological landscape of the world.|In this new paradigm, tradition and revolution are not antagonistic but complementary, creating a dynamic synthesis that defines the future. As the final curtain falls, the global order is irrevocably altered, marking the rise of an era where red revolutionarism and the legacy of aristocratism are inextricably intertwined, guiding the course of history with an unprecedented vision.\r\nRain ruined all plans.\r\nIntervene in Romania\r\nNow that we have high influence in the world, and control South America enough to form an opposition group out of Romanian embassy officials, we can pressure Ceausescu's associates to ‘change sides’ while the Ceausescu couple is still in power and Romania itself is in a dire economic situation.\r\nIntervene in East Germany\r\nNow that Wendehals has consolidated himself in power, we can contact him and work out a unified position on the further reorganisation of sovereign East Germany with our active financial and diplomatic support.\r\nIntervene in Czechoslovakia\r\nCzechoslovakia's conservative leadership is afraid of the fundamental reforms being shouted from Moscow. It is time to talk to old Czechoslovak friends and find a common position of opposition to Moscow.... Or get in touch with the opponents of the conservatives and support the forces of reformism which are favourable to us!\r\nBought out Romania's debt bonds\r\nWendehals is at the head of the GDR\r\nAt least {0} pro-Chinese countries in COMECON\r\nIsn't this the new Führer?\r\nIn a month's time, Austria will hold new parliamentary elections. Analysts predict that, for the first time in history, the Social Democratic Party will hold a simple majority in parliament and will be able to continue to actively pursue integration programmes with Western Europe. But is this to our advantage?|Some advisers suggest taking advantage of the situation and attacking the ‘amnestied’ and ‘escaped’ Nazis who are now in the leadership of the Austrian People's Party and the Austrian Freedom Party. In this way we will show the world that there is no escape for the fascists!|However, a more radical faction proposes to interfere in the elections and prevent the victory of the pro-European forces by discrediting the leader of the Social Democrats, Bruno Kreisky. He has a number of anti-Semitic statements and has repeatedly defended politicians from the former NSDAP who have made careers in other Austrian parties. Just mix this truth with a couple of falsified documents of lies and the scandal will be serious.\r\nThrow in falsehoods and stir up a scandal in the Socintern and among the Communists about Bruno Kraisky's Nazism\r\nOrganise an operation to liquidate Nazis hiding in Austria who are involved in far-right activities.\r\nThis is not our business.\r\nWe don't have enough agent networks (need 20.0).\r\nWe don't have enough money in our Swiss bank account (need 20.0).\r\nWe don't have enough global influence (need 30.0).\r\nDespite the fact that Bruno Kreisky himself is Jewish and barely escaped Dachau (his former prison cellmate from the Austrofascist period turned out to be a member of the pro-Nazi movement and released him thanks to that acquaintance), after the liberation of Austria he embraced Austrian nationalism, advocating a sovereign Austria and an Austrian national path to democratic socialism. This developed not only into further alliances with ‘former Nazis’ from present-day politicians, but also into vehement refusals to sack ministers, even when it was discovered that they were members of the NSDAP. This even led him to make odious remarks saying that ‘everyone has the right to make a mistake’ and ‘Israel has no right to interfere in Austria's internal affairs.’ In return, even far-right Austrian politicians, whose relatives had close contacts with the SS during World War II, spoke warmly of Bruno Kreisky, calling him ‘neither a Jew nor a Zionist, but just an Austrian.’ This situation created the perfect opportunity to use the good old fashioned trick of mixing a little lie into the truth and serving it up with the right sauce. We wrote several articles saying that he was ‘on the hook’ with the ex-Nazi lobby for having escaped Dachau ‘by giving up the addresses of other Jews in hiding to the SS’, which is why he behaves this way in public. After this, similar articles from ‘independent analysts’ were sent to the Socintern and to the offices of other world communist parties. This created a huge scandal both in Austria and abroad. And despite Bruno's own attempts to deny all this, and the Austrian Social Democratic Party leadership to insist that it was ‘unsubstantiated speculation’, such a blow before the elections could knock the ground out from under the Social Democrats and prevent them from getting enough votes to form a one-party government.\r\nThe sponsored and propagandised relatives of the Jewish victims, with our support, went ‘for tourist purposes’ to Austria, where they ‘found’ homemade pistols and rifles converted from pneumatic guns in secret caches organised by us. Then, on different days and times of day, three assassination attempts were made - high-ranking ‘former’ Nazis in leading positions in the extreme right-wing Austrian Freedom Party - Friedrich Peter and Jörg Haider, and the same in the Austrian People's Party - Josef Riegler - were attacked. Not all assassination attempts resulted in instant death, but the survivors died in the hospital. The case resonated worldwide and eventually the arrested Jews were expelled to Israel, where they were immediately amnestied, and the Chinese prestige of the fighters against world Nazism rose.\r\nThe Social Democrats eventually took a simple majority, but went into coalition with the Austrian Freedom Party, whose leader in return began moving his party from right wing to liberalism. This party then joined the Liberal International and, together with the Social Democrats, took part in further processes of Austria's integration into Western structures and systems.\r\nAustrofascism 2.0\r\nIn Austria, a dangerous situation is being created where all three leading parties are beginning to lean towards active Eurocentrism and joining Western European organisations. One striking example is the Austrian Freedom Party, whose leader Friedrich Peter, although a former member of the SS, has befriended the leader of the Social Democrats and is now trying to adopt a more liberal programme in order to further join the Liberal International. The programme of transition towards support for a free market economy and integration into Western European structures is opposed by an active part of the party, in particular by the prominent young Jörg Haider, former head of the party's youth wing and current head of the party's branch in the Carinthia region. However, the Israeli authorities are also unhappy with the leader of the Social Democrats and the leader of the Freedom Party, which we can take advantage of if we have made enough friends with Israel to provide our agents with Israeli uniforms, weapons and documents. However, if we cannot or do not want to, we can simply issue a joint proclamation with Israel condemning the Nazi domination of the Austrian top leadership.\r\nAssassinate Friedrich Peter and blame it on the Mossad.\r\nIssue a joint proclamation with Israel.\r\nTrade with Israel, Syria and Iraq is required.\r\nTrade with Israel required.\r\nHaving agreed with the Arab secret services and providing them with Israeli devices bought with corruption, we jointly organised an operation to assassinate Friedrich Peter, the leader of the Austrian Freedom Freedom Party, leaving a tip-off on the ‘Israeli trail’, which strengthened the position of the Austrian right-wing radicals. The assassination caused a major scandal in the Austrian press, as well as within the party itself, as a result of which the liberal party elements were sidelined and the young Jörg Haider became the head of the party with a new populist programme: rejection of European integration, Euroscepticism, restriction of immigration, prohibition of foreigners and dual nationals from owning and renting land, nationalisation of foreign agro-assets, introduction of a flat income tax scale and a tax on currency speculation. This programme was able to attract both the radical electorate and a layer of small and medium-sized businesses, providing the party with an unprecedented increase in voter support from 5% to 17%.\r\nAfter negotiations with the Israeli ambassador, we decided to issue a joint declaration condemning the Nazi infestation in the higher party apparatuses of Austria's leading parties and called on them to lustrate the Nazi elements. The Austrian Social Democrat leader Bruno Kraisky naturally protested and demanded ‘no interference in Austria's internal affairs’, but the international community appreciated our dedication to the fight against Nazism. However, some of our party members are unhappy with our co-operation with Israel, saying that Zionism is just a new form of Nazism.\r\nAs a result of further changes, the Austrian Freedom Party joined the Liberal International and adopted a new liberal programme close to the German FDP.\r\nAustrians' Choice\r\nThanks to our preparatory actions, the Social Democrats fell back to 1970 in terms of seats, winning 12 seats less than in the previous election. The Austrian People's Party also lost 6 seats, while the Austrian Freedom Party won 16 per cent of the vote and 33 seats in parliament for the first time. In this situation, the Austrian People's Party and the Austrian Freedom Party decided to form a right-wing coalition government. The leader of the first party, Josef Taus, with a moderate right-conservative programme, became chancellor. However, in order to preserve the alliance, Austria suspended its participation in all Western European institutions at the request of Jörg Haider and adopted a diplomatic line of Euroscepticism. However, this Euroscepticism and the admission of a right-wing radical party into the ruling coalition was a violation of the ‘cordon sanitaire’ - the European unspoken project to prevent any right-wing and left-wing radicals from entering the government. As a consequence, diplomatic contacts of NATO and Western European countries with Austria were curtailed and sanctions were imposed on Austria, hitting its economy. Seven months after this, Josef Taus announced his resignation. The fate of the coalition hangs by a hair and perhaps now is the time to help the anti-social democratic forces to win the intra-party struggle of the Austrian People's Party? The representative of such forces is sovereignty advocate and new rightist Josef Riegler.\r\nProvide secret financial support to Josef Rigler\r\nAttempt to assassinate the leader of the Social Democrats\r\nThe recent scandal surrounding the leader of the Social Democrats, the rise of the Austrian Freedom Party, and the blowback from seemingly allies has exposed the contradictions within the Austrian People's Party. By providing secret financial assistance through several charitable foundations we were able to help the more Eurosceptic wing of the party to poach some party members and propagandise the electorate. As a result, an old ally of the Social Democrats, Josef Taus, resigned as party chairman and his place was taken by Josef Rigler. The coalition of the Austrian People's Party and the Austrian Freedom Party was confirmed. The new government programme replacing the old moderate right-conservative programme was the project of a ‘green social market economy’ combining the modern West German economic model with green politics and extreme Euroscepticism. {0}\r\nWe tried to retry our old plan to use Arab mercenaries disguised as Mossad to eliminate our enemy. But this time, after the previous incident, the Austrian security services were on standby. In the end, the assassination attempt failed, but the situation led to some temporary conflict between NATO countries and the Arab world, which hit American influence in the world. At the same time in Austria, the Austrian People's Party ended its coalition with the Austrian Freedom Party and re-entered into a coalition with the Social Democrat. The Chancellor of Austria was again the permanent Bruno Krajski.\r\nIn the end, for the sake of lifting sanctions and normalising the economy, the Austrian People's Party ended its coalition with the Austrian Freedom Party and went back into coalition with the Social Democrats. The Chancellor of Austria is again the permanent Bruno Krajski. Our whole plan to stop Austria's movement into the Western European fold had failed.\r\nTo circumvent the Western European blockade, Rigler decided to build bridges with Hungary, in particular with one of its prominent figures, Imre Pozsgay. In the course of negotiations, the two politicians drew up a diplomatic project for the creation of a partnership between Austria and Hungary, which, with the mediation of Otto von Habsburg, evolved into the ‘Pan-European Picnic’ organisation. The aim of the new organisation is to jointly counteract international pressure on the basis of the historical legacy of friendship between Hungarians and Austrians. Formally, the organisation did not violate the programmes of either the COMECON nor the Warsaw Pact, so, despite protests from the USSR, the Hungarian parliament (and later the Austrian parliament) ratified this agreement, beginning an era of a new joint diplomatic, cultural and trade partnership.\r\nTo circumvent the Western European blockade, Rigler decided to build bridges with the countries of the East, in particular with the Arab countries, Iran, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary and us. The reorientation of the Austrian economy was not painless, but under the slogans of sovereignty and the revival of Austrian identity, Austria was able to rebuild its economy and learn to circumvent any sanctions through the ‘countries of the East’ - Eastern Europe, the Arab world and through China. In particular, we have become one of Austria's main economic partners in the new era.\r\nThe last days of Austria\r\nThe creation of Austria-Hungary caused an outbreak of discontent in the country, nationalist rallies began, which hit the image of the ruling coalition. The Social Democrats tried to take advantage of this, thus trying to achieve snap elections in which they would definitely be able to gain a majority. But then the Hungarian labour militia came into action. Dressed in civilian clothes and carrying various kinds of sticks and batons, they crossed the border at various points (considering that the border as such no longer existed) and then staged provocations, forcing the protesters to fight with them. In this way the Austrian law enforcement authorities were able to arrest the leaders of the rallies for short periods of time as organisers of fights and hooliganism in the streets. Then, at night, ‘unknown’ people set fire to St Stephen's Cathedral, on the basis of which the Austrian government declared a state of emergency in the country, all rallies were banned and protesters were dispersed with water cannons.|Having extinguished the main wave of unrest, the integration of the Austrian economy with the Hungarian economy began to yield its first fruits - cheap Hungarian agricultural products and cars flowed to Austria and cheap meat products to Hungary. The unification of energy structures also made it possible to reduce the price for electricity usage. All this led to a clear improvement in the standard of living of Austrian citizens, which gradually erased all popular discontent. The next step was the unifying congress of the Austrian People's Party and the Austrian Freedom Party into a single Austrian People's Party of Freedom. An analogue of the Acerbo Law was then effectively introduced in the country, finally establishing de facto one-party hegemony in Austria. The situation stabilised and the government remained firmly in power, sending representatives to the Federal Council of Austria-Hungary.\r\nIn the never-ending confrontation with sanctions, Austria continued to drift further and further away from Western Europe. The Social Democratic Party gradually lost its former influence and was replaced by the Austrian People's Party, which firmly took over the left-wing social and green agenda from the Social Democrats, thus becoming culturally right-wing but socially and economically left-wing. The Austrian Freedom Party took over the right-wing economic spectrum, advocating protectionism, keeping foreign enterprises out of the economy, rejecting immigration, supporting a flat tax scale and fighting speculation on currency and other speculations. With the change of the electoral system from proportional to majoritarian, the Social Democrats were finally defeated in the elections and split into left-wing liberals led by Viktor Klima and democratic socialists led by Jörg Leichtfried. Austria eventually became an associate member of the COMECON and an observer of many Asian and Arab organisations, becoming the main bastion of right-wing Euroscepticism in Europe.\r\nAustrian politics continues to go on as it has been.\r\nPozhgay's course\r\nHaving received full information about what was happening in the country, Imre Pozhgai realised the depth of the economic problem and made a strong-willed decision that \"the policy of chimera must stop\". Realising that this was not the right geopolitical moment for a complete liberalisation of the state, the new General Secretary co-opted a group of solid moderate reformers into the Politburo: the commander of the Workers' Militia, Shandor Borbey; the leader of the first rock theatre, director and writer Matyas Ustich; the academician, biologist, geographer and activist for the revival of national history, Istvan Kiseli; and the head of the Economic Policy Department of the Central Committee of the ruling Party, Miklos Nemeth. They formed a tacit group to prepare the reforms. The four of them developed the so-called \"Gábor Bethlen\" programme, which included a revival of national history and morality, rapprochement with religious organisations, limited deregulation of the economy, expansion of private business and a comprehensive fight against Zionism and \"Gypsy criminal diasporas\". However, the programme has not yet taken its final form, as Sándor Borbely insists on a more pragmatic economic approach, while István Kysely proposes to rely on national culture in this matter.|{0}|The final choice still depends on our vote as holders of Hungarian debt bonds. What should we advise?\r\nOn the other hand, there was an interesting proposal from the head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the ruling Party: against the background of the serious rapprochement with Austria on multiple positions in recent years, Gyula Horn proposes to respond to the tacit proposal of the Austrian Chancellor and to start working out a project for the unification of Austria and Hungary into a single confederation under the leadership of a neutral nominal monarch. However, the Soviet Union may react very aggressively to this, if it does not find worthy mediators in the negotiations....\r\nWe support Borbey's approach\r\nKiseli's strange plan is preferable\r\nGyula Horn probably knows what he's doing.\r\nThere are no prerequisites for the revival of Austria-Hungary.\r\nAfter a series of personnel changes, the Congress of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Party officially adopted a pragmatic version of the \"Gábor Bethlen Programme\" as the official programme for the coming five-year period. The project envisages cautious economic reforms and a transition to a revival of Hungarian national consciousness within the framework of a \"Marxist realisation of the national question\". Despite Moscow's guarded protests on the sidelines, Pozhgai reaffirmed Hungary's membership in CMEA and the OVD and even promised Moscow an end to its policy of endless borrowing from the Western powers.\r\nAfter a series of personnel reshuffles, the Congress of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Party officially adopted the nationalist version of the \"Gábor Bethlen Programme\" as the official programme for the coming five-year period. The draft envisages semi-syndicalist economic reforms and a move to revive Hungary's national identity \"suppressed by centuries of Austrian and German domination\". Despite Moscow's guarded protests on the sidelines, Pozhgai reaffirmed Hungary's membership in CMEA and the OVD and even promised Moscow an end to its policy of endless borrowing from Western powers.\r\nAttempts by Hungary and Austria to start the process of merger, and even more so under a new king, caused serious misgivings from Moscow. Attempts at behind-the-scenes negotiations between Budapest and Moscow failed, and there were no mediators acceptable to both sides. As a result, when the Hungarian authorities openly announced their intention to ratify in the near future the treaty on unification into a confederation with Austria under the single crown of the yet-to-be-elected monarch, Moscow again brought in the tanks. Strangely enough, some of the comrades of the \"new Imre Nadja\" also defected to the side of the Soviet Union, namely the entire foursome of the reform group co-opted by Pozhgai. There was no resistance and, as a result, Požgai and the entire leadership of the ruling Party were arrested and power passed into the hands of the government formed under the leadership of Borbey. The country tightened censorship and the rights of the law enforcement agencies, re-established the special services, the economy switched back to a planned economy with financial support from Moscow, but in the socio-political sphere nationalist propaganda was launched to pacify the masses. The VSRP was reorganised into the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Party and the symbols of the state were returned to the attributes of the Hungarian kingdom, but without the crown and monarchical regalia.|At the same time, practically none of the socialist and communist parties of the world condemned the Soviet troops this time, believing that the reactionary attempt to restore the monarchy and the Austro-Hungarian imperialist experiment was a far more terrible event than another Soviet intervention.\r\nAttempts by Hungary and Austria to begin the merger process, and even more so under a new king, caused no-nonsense misgivings from Moscow. {0}|In the course of behind-the-scenes negotiations, a compromise was reached, allowing the Soviet Union to feel safe and even increase in some ways anti-American stronghold of the socialist camp. The new Austro-Hungarian Confederation would join the CMEA as a single entity (including Austria), withdrawing from all Western structures (including the IMF), accepting a neutral non-aligned status (thus leaving the OVD), but Soviet military bases would remain on Hungarian territory (without the right to switch to the Austrian side) without the right to expand them; at the same time, Hungary was guaranteed to retain the one-party regime of the Socialist Party. The question of coronation was also postponed for 3 years, but the coronation was allowed on condition that neither the Habsburgs (this was a condition of the Hungarian side) nor representatives of the existing monarchical regimes (at the request of the Soviet side) would ascend the throne. The whole world was shocked by this outcome! \r\nHowever, we were able to mediate the negotiations between Budapest and Moscow in time.\r\nHowever, Romanian President Ceausescu was able to mediate negotiations between Budapest and Moscow in time.\r\nThe new 1001\r\nThe stalemate economic situation in Hungary was resolved by the reform package of the new group of 4 reformers with the favoured notes of Sándor Borbey. Free business and entrepreneurship of all forms was allowed in all areas of the economy except the strategically important ones. There was also a complete deregulation of prices for everything and FEZs were opened for foreign investors. However, there was no privatisation and even a law was passed prohibiting privatisation, as well as the minimum wage and social guarantees remained the same. It was officially declared that \"Hungary's agrarian economy was not yet ready for socialism and required a return to the Leninist practices of the transition economy\". At the same time, a national revival began in politics: many figures of Hungarian history from earlier than the 20th century were rehabilitated, schools began to teach the basics of morality and ethics, monuments and alleys in honour of heroes of the past began to appear, while Zionism and the \"Gypsy Mafia\" were declared enemies of the state, which led to the deportation of Roma to specially created ghettos. World analysts have already dubbed the established regime \"neo-Horticism\", but the situation inside the country is only stabilising more. And Western countries have decided to collectively impose both economic and personal sanctions on such an ‘inhumane authoritarian dictatorship.’\r\nThe stalemate economic situation in Hungary was resolved by the reform package of the new group of 4 reformers with István Kyseli's notes favoured. A complete deregulation of prices was carried out, and all state-owned enterprises were fully self-governed and self-supporting and divided into open joint-stock companies, only formally remaining state-owned. At the same time, even the heads and directors of the enterprises were approved by the Boards of Shareholders of the enterprises, and the personnel work was completely handed over to the Boards of Directors of the enterprises. Some may say that there was a de facto privatisation of the economy in favour of full capitalism, but the state retained the banking and financial sphere and the sole right to restructure and close down enterprises, since neither private business nor currency exchanges were officially legalised in the country. Thus, the state indirectly \"keeps the pulse\" on the hands of these de facto private joint-stock enterprises by closing or splitting up unwanted and controlling banks. But to conceal the transition to limited capitalism, the new forms of enterprises were declared as \"people's corporate co-operatives\" and new regulatory laws were introduced: workers could only be fired with the consent of the majority of the enterprise's labour collective, and each worker (as long as he or she was a worker) had to own at least 1 share in the enterprise. At the same time, a national revival began in politics: many figures of Hungarian history from the earlier 20th century and even some untainted figures of the Horthy regime were rehabilitated, schools began to teach the basics of morality, ethics and Christianity (and each school got its own priest), monuments and alleys in honour of heroes of the past began to appear, and Zionism and the \"Gypsy Mafia\" were declared enemies of the state, which led to the mass deportation of believers in Judaism and inhabitants of Gypsy settlements to Austria. The Workers' Militia was also reorganised into the Hungarian Guard, changing its statutes and symbols and turning it into an analogue of the Legionnaires, with Sándor Borbely remaining at its head. Istvan Kiseli himself headed a new organisation, the Association for the Preservation of Traditions and Culture, which subordinated the Ministry of Education and Culture and all public, artistic and educational organisations, dictating a new spiritual-nationalist order. Such a policy was eventually labelled \"the Hungarian path to socialism\". But world analysts have already dubbed the established regime \"neo-Salashism\"; however, the situation inside the country is only stabilising more. And Western countries have decided to collectively impose both economic and personal sanctions on such an ‘inhumane authoritarian dictatorship.’\r\nFurther reforms to calibrate and integrate the Austrian and Hungarian economies were moderate: Austria nationalised strategically important areas of the economy and the banking and finance sector without the right of private business to intervene in them and banned foreign capital, while Hungary went through complete price deregulation with legalisation of small and medium-sized businesses (but without any privatisation). At the same time, a single planning committee was formed at the confederal level, conducting five-year indicative \"planning\". A unicameral Federal Parliament was also formed at the confederal level, which was assigned only 2 roles: ratification of foreign policy agreements and election of its own President. The latter was given the power to form the Federal Government, responsible for the implementation of uniform labour, customs and economic codes, regulations and laws. Hungary itself underwent some reforms to liberalise politics while maintaining the leading role of the party - alternative elections to councils were allowed, where non-party and a few candidates from the ruling party could run. It is worth noting that on the Hungarian side the Holy Crown Commission for the search for a suitable monarch was headed by the historian, professor and doctoral candidate István Kállai. It was to this commission that the sensational decision was made to invite Charles Napoleon Bonaparte, who had been deprived of his rights to the throne by his father - rejected by all Bonopartists, deprived of any inheritance, this Napoleon had taken part in all the left-wing riots in France and was an activist of the Socialist Party of France. Bruised and not recognising his own abdication Charles gladly agreed to take the nominal throne of the Confederation of Austria and Hungary and accepted all three conditions of the commission - to move the headquarters of his business to Vienna, registering it as an Austro-Hungarian business, to recognise as heirs to the Austro-Hungarian throne exclusively the children of his second marriage (not recognised by all Bonapartists) and to renounce the citizenship of all other states. Thus the Bonapartes became legal monarchs again, albeit in a completely outlandish way. And Western countries have decided to collectively impose both economic and personal sanctions on such an ‘inhumane authoritarian dictatorship.’\r\nThe Hungarians have not gone back to the past.\r\nConfederal People's Democratic Kingdom of Austria and Hungary\r\nChaos is a ladder\r\nAnd in order to gain control over Yugoslavia, we need not just to support the most stable party, but to make a radical leap, contributing to a sharp change in the country's top cadres. However, having accounts and enterprises in Yugoslavia, as well as owning debt obligations of this country, we could support some or other radicals in order to tie Yugoslavia, isolated from the whole world, to ourselves. We have three candidates in mind: the chairman of the Belgrade regional committee and nationalist economist Slobodan Milosevic, the radical right-wing dissident writer Vojislav Šešelj and the moderate dissident nationalist and supporter of A. Ranković Dobrica Ćosić. Using different levers of influence we should support one of them....\r\nTo support Milosevic\r\nGet Šešelj out and \"gift\" him the business\r\nLegalise Čosić and \"gift\" him the business\r\nOur representative went to Yugoslavia and also destabilise Kosovo\r\nWe had to destabilise Kosovo beforehand.\r\nThrough the Yugoslav embassy, the desire to do further business with Slobodan Milosevic was conveyed, after which the latter began to rise considerably in his career. In the meantime, funds were transferred through third-party accounts for his popularisation, international newspapers of our supporters began to praise him, and many students, secretly MGB officers, were sent to the major cities of Yugoslavia \"on exchange\" to conduct intelligence, bribe the right people and carry out illegal violent actions.\r\nAgainst the background of instability in Yugoslavia, our unspoken pressure to release Vojislav Šešelj from detention with guarantees that he would not be prosecuted worked. Having obtained his freedom and political immunity with our support, he organised his own business with the profits of which he started publishing his own newspaper and established a public historical association of Serbian nationalist intellectuals. Also, with our mediation, secret contacts were established between him and representatives of the Karadjordjevic and Petrovic-Nigosi dynasties. And now Šešelj is sure that China is the only friend of his revanchist plans and ideas in the whole world.\r\nThe deepening instability in Yugoslavia once again brought Dobritz Ćosić into the political arena, this time as the leader of Serbia's national and nationalist intelligentsia. There we caught him, making secret contact and assuring him of our sincere support for the restoration of justice for the Serbian people. With our support, he set up his own business, from the profits of which he was able to expand his organisation's cells throughout Yugoslavia, although mainly among Serbian communities, but this is already making his community a new popular force in the country.\r\nBelgrade Restoration\r\nMilošević's rapid rise up the career ladder, under our tacit pressure and his own sagacity, was able to become Chairman of the Federal Executive Council of Yugoslavia after the scandalous economic decisions of the previous chairman. In this way Slobodan concentrated enormous power in his hands, while we at the same time completely forgave all Yugoslav debts, thereby further increasing Milosevic's support in the Party and among the people. At the same time, Slobodan won the support of the YNA leadership, which was interested in preserving the integrity of the country.|Declaring that the country needed economic reforms first and foremost, not ‘’a starving democracy‘’, Milosevic stopped political liberalisation and moved on to a plan for economic ones.|As part of the economic reforms, small and medium-sized businesses were legalised, a progressive tax scale was introduced, millionaires and the free sale of personal property (including flats) were legalised. Borders were opened, prices were deregulated, and co-operatives and enterprises were turned into open joint-stock companies, where the state retained only 51 per cent of shares and sold the rest to various holders. Thus a de facto dirigism with a high presence of the state was established in the country. And this form of capitalism allowed stabilising the economy, restoring the supply of food, electricity and petrol, thus consolidating Milosevic's position on the political arena.|While economic reforms were being carried out, Yugoslavia's intelligence services were gradually emptying the territorial defence depots of the republics under the guise of transferring cargoes to other places, outdating weaponry and burning the storages, gradually disarming the national armed forces.|And finally, having stabilised his power, Milosevic struck. First, an unspoken formulary on the priority of promoting persons of Serbian and Montenegrin nationality in all political organisations was dropped, leading to a flood of representatives of these peoples into the central government. Then the election of heads of republics and regions by local authorities was cancelled and replaced by direct appointment by order of the Central Committee of the LCY. After this, Serbs and Montenegrins began to be appointed en masse to command positions throughout the country. This led to hysteria among the national opposition in the Union republics and mass protests. Water cannon squads were deployed against the latter, while the former began to be rounded up by armed units of the YNA. However, the separatist party leaders responded by trying to raise the territorial harrow, but the latter had to arm themselves only with pistols, hunting rifles, pitchforks and axes. A state of emergency was declared throughout the country, during which the Yugoslav army, supported by armed units of Serbian vigilantes, quickly eliminated the leaders of the radical opposition. Milosevic eventually won.|After the victory, a complete cadre reorganisation began. While officially preserving the equality of all peoples, Serbs were so favoured that they assumed positions of authority in all republics and bodies, gradually centralising the power of all apparatuses and economic structures in Belgrade.|And the old titoism was replaced by an idea of national paternalism taken from the Kingdom's methodologies - Milosevic proclaimed Serbs as ‘the vanguard nation of Yugoslavia’, which ‘guides, leads and supports the younger brothers’ represented by the other peoples of the country.\r\nGradually, Vojislav Šešelj gathered around him an extensive network of national Serbian intellectuals, which later developed into the Serbian National Renewal movement, including the famous ‘dissidents’ Mirko Jović, Dragoslav Bokan, Vuk Drasković, Žarko Gavrilović, Dobrica Ćosić and others. | Together, in 1989, after the beginning of Ante Marković's political liberalisation reforms, they put forward a manifesto demanding the immediate dissolution of the Presidency of the SFRY and the restoration of the office of President with free national elections. This manifesto was initially distributed through samizdat and newspapers, but it gained such popularity that Šenšelj himself led mass demonstrations in its favour. In the end, Prime Minister Markovic and the Politburo had to concede, and thus the first presidential elections were held in March 1990. Before this, however, Šešelj, with our mediation, gave philosophical talks at universities in Europe and the United States, where he established active links with the émigré Chetniks and the monarchical houses of Karadjordjević and Petrović-Njegoša, receiving from them a significant share of funding and international diplomatic support. |His success at rallies, large financial support, calls for radical reforms (including in the economy), monarchism and European approval (as the West hoped Šešelj would decommunise the regime and democratise it) allowed Šešelj to win the election and become President. The European support did not last long, however, as Vojislav embarked on very different reforms than expected.|First, all Chetniks were rehabilitated, their citizenship was restored, and many of them returned to Yugoslavia as experienced army veterans with investments and weapons, forming an unofficial armed movement in support of Šešelj. |The new president then dismissed the government of Ante Markovic and, under popular pressure, the Assembly handed over the right to form a government to the well-known dissident Vuk Draskovic.|The new government began to implement fundamental economic reforms: all enterprises, factories, farms and even land were privatised, excluding strategically important areas of the economy and banks. And the fact that China completely cancelled all debts on the existing debt obligations of Yugoslavia had a very positive impact on the success of this ‘shock therapy’. Moreover, in the course of this, many enterprises passed into the hands of millionaires, officials and even Chetniks who had returned from exile, associated with nationalist Serbian organisations.|And then announced the restructuring of Yugoslavia: the formation of parties was allowed and multi-party general elections were restored. After such party liberalisation, the communist parties in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia collapsed - the first two reorganised into social-democratic parties and the last one split into two. Seeing the collapse of the republican communist parties, Šešelj made a provocative speech in which he firmly denounced ‘Yugoslavism’ for ‘belittling and degrading Serbian culture’ and demanded ‘the restoration of historical territorial justice for Serbia’. And that was the last straw: Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence, at which point almost the entire leadership of the YNA sided with Šešelj. |Opinions on how to resolve the conflict with the Western republics and Šešelj's own anti-Yugoslav policy split Serbian National Renewal into two parts: the more liberal Serbian Renewal Movement, led by Vuk Drasković and Dobrica Ćosić; and the extreme right-wing Serbian Radical Party, where Mirko Jović, Dragoslav Bokan, Žarko Gavrilović and Šešelj himself remained. Such a division could have had a negative impact on the situation and destroyed Serbia, so the army decided to act with lightning speed.|\r\nAgainst the background of economic decline, ethnic strife and liberalisation, Dobritz Čosić's organisation was able to find sympathisers even in many echelons of the Communist Party, and so successfully organised numerous rallies throughout the country with armed guards, at which Čosić and his associates began to demand \"an end to Tito's insane legacy, the dissolution of the Presidency of the SFRY and free popular elections of the President\". Under the pressure of the masses and party figures, the reformist Ante Markovic was forced to agree to these demands. And the whole nation honoured Čosić as the winner.| Thus, in March 1990, the first presidential elections took place. And Ćosić, who had gained national fame, the support of a number of party members and campaign funding with the backing of traditionalist intellectuals, was able to win the election as the new president of Yugoslavia.|Many expected Ćosić, who had previously espoused nationalist Serbian rhetoric, to rush to break Yugoslav foundations, but he himself was diplomatic and moderate. In the course of numerous negotiations, the Serbian part of Kosovo became part of Serbia, and the Albanian-populated parts of Kosovo and Macedonia formed together an Albanian Autonomous Region within Yugoslavia, although not bordering each other. The next step was the diplomatic resolution of the Bosnia problem with the mediation of Europe and China: Bosnia was divided into 10 ethnic districts, thus 3 for each nation, and Sarajevo became a multi-ethnic autonomy with a functioning parliament composed equally of representatives of each of the 9 ethnic districts. But Slovenia and Croatia were much more complicated.|Cosic's economic reforms made Croats and Slovenes very angry. After all, he completely abolished self-government at local and national level and subjected all enterprises and collective farms to a centralised planning authority in Belgrade as part of the restoration of the five-year plan «according to the Soviet model». At the same time, Aleksandar Ranković's group was rehabilitated and recognised as heroes of Yugoslavia and \"fighters against titoist cosmopolitanism and counter-revolution\", and its survivors were accepted as advisers of the President. The Croatian and Slovenian governments refused to comply with these decisions despite the fact that Yugoslavia's debt obligations were cancelled by China, which had a positive impact on the country's budget and economy. They even announced the initiation of a referendum on secession. But the new authorities could not allow this to happen. Having mobilised the army and Serbian inhabitants of those regions, the central government struck first, disarming Slovenia and starting a massacre in Croatia. Despite threats and sanctions from Europe and the United States, supported by China, the Yugoslavs did not retreat and, in the course of long battles, even starved Zagreb out. In the end, the separatists lost.|But Croatia and Slovenia were not stripped of their republican status, only pledged to establish broad autonomy for Serb communities. Then a unifying congress of republic-level communist parties was held and a unified People’s Labour Party of Yugoslavia was formed throughout Yugoslavia, whose ideology was proclaimed to be \"Yugoslav patriotism\", \"internationalism\" and \"Soviet power\".Yugoslavia, isolated from Europe, returned to the idea of a centralised state and centralised economy, Serbs got their \"justice taken from them by Josip Tito\" - own autonomous communities and a guaranteed right to an equal share of subsidies from the budget, and Rankovic became a national hero and unifier. \r\nSerbia failed to get revenge.\r\nThe fate of two peoples\r\nNow that the radical reform faction has come to power in Moscow, there is a split in Czechoslovakia itself. On one side stand the former opponents of reform in the form of the Moscow faction headed by Štrougal and the young pragmatic reformists headed by Čalfa, while on the other side stand Dubček's former associates Gustav Husák, Miloš Jákés and Vasil Bilák. And we are influential enough in the world and have enough connections to intervene cautiously in the growing split and prepare the ground for changing the Czechoslovak course in the direction we want. And with this we can be helped by solving the Church question, because the Church is one of the main pillars of the opposition in the country. Firstly, we can persuade the Moscow Reformist faction to get in touch with the left-wing Czech Evangelical Church, the Hussites, who are in favour of social justice and social democracy, thus finally giving the reformists a support among the people. Secondly, we can do the same, but at the same time hint to the Czechoslovak authorities about the danger of the current leadership of this church and, with the support of the Czech security services, try to shift power into the hands of Dan Drapal, the leader of a charismatic movement based on the rejection of nationalities and support for innovations with the adoption of modern youth trends. Thirdly, we can reach an agreement with the anti-reform faction and persuade them to reach an agreement with the individual dignitaries of the most loyal church, the Czech Brothers, who are also Hussites. Previously under the state supervision of the communist regime, the Church of the Czech Brothers could not resolve many different theological and ecclesiological issues, and disputes within the church gradually increased, reducing the religious threat of the mainstream religious school in the country. But now, perhaps it is time to push this Church towards the Soviet practice of Renewalism?\r\nUnite the Moscow Reformist Faction with the Czech Evangelical Church\r\nTo carry out a multi-strategy to unite the Moscow-reformist faction with the charismatic current\r\nConvince opponents of reform to take lessons from the Renewalists and Liberation Theology\r\nRequires an Islamic revolution in Iran and the defeat of Israel in the war\r\nThrough our mediation, the Moscow and Reformist factions made contact with the Czech Evangelical Church, where they agreed to co-operate fully to restore the democratic reforms of the Dubček era, with Alexander Dubček himself tentatively agreed to lead the country after the ouster of Gustav Husák.\r\nThrough our mediation, the Moscow and Reformist factions, despite their great differences of opinion, were able to reach an agreement with the charismatic current of the Czech Evangelical Church, deciding to coordinate joint actions to gradually dismantle the current regime and return to democratic values and full freedom of Christian preaching and the formation of Christian communes. Then, with the support of the secret services, Dan Drapal began to receive financial tranches and discrediting materials on opponents within the Church, thanks to which he expanded the network of influence of his movement and was eventually able to take control of the Church.\r\nThe anti-reform faction led by Gustav Husák and Vasil Bílák decided to change their approach to the leading Church of the Czech Brethren and, with the support of the secret services, made contact with its most socially-oriented representatives. With the promise of an end to church restrictions, these representatives entered into a tacit alliance with the government and began to promote a socialist trend within the Church.\r\nCzechoslovak brotherhood\r\nCoordinating together, the social-liberal Czech Evangelical Church and the Moscow Reformist faction were able to organise peaceful protests that led to resignations in the Communist Party leadership and its reorganisation into a socialist party. The Church was careful to ensure that the protests did not turn violent and that the minds of the youth were not taken over by various nationalist organisations. Even the clergy themselves soon joined the party, infiltrating the Politburo.|In the course of the reforms, Dubček was elected President of the Czecho-Slovak Republic, which was led by a reformist-church coalition. Religion was given special status in the constitution, politics was fully liberalised and the economy was shifted to a cooperative market economy without private property but with full price deregulation and competition between different cooperatives. Nationalist parties were nevertheless widely persecuted.|Czech Republic and Slovakia were given equal status within the BSR, and state bodies were divided between the two capitals. Eventually, the Socialist Party of Štrougal and Dubček was able to retain its leadership in parliament, but became a de facto puppet of the churchmen, adopting social liberal religious Hussism even into its political programme.\r\nCoordinating together, the charismatic Czech Evangelical Church and the Moscow Reformist faction were able to organise peaceful protests that led to resignations in the Communist Party leadership and its reorganisation as a socialist party. However, Chalfa and Dan Drapal then outplayed the Moscow faction and knocked the former communists off the pedestal. On the basis of the pragmatic wing of the former communists and cells of the charismatic Drapal Church, the Christian Social Party of Czechoslovakia was formed. Czechoslovakia was then reorganised into a multitude of self-governing communes on neither national nor ethnic lines, with the languages of Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Ruthenian, Ukrainian and German being equal. The capital was moved to the Moravian city of Stare Mesto, the ancient capital of Great Moravia. However, the communes received the right only to internal self-government, and all local state property without the right to privatise it and the local budget were transferred to their ownership. However, all kinds of business were allowed and price policy was completely deregulated.|Dissatisfied with the elimination of national division, Czech and Slovak organisations were quickly confronted by the second side of the Christian Social Party, namely the vocal arms of messianic religious fanatics who began to disperse \"all demonic spawn\" in the form of nationalists, fascists and liberals.|The new Czechoslovak parliament began to be formed half from representatives elected from the communes and half from representatives of the country's officially registered Christian churches. This situation, with full financial, administrative and agent support, allowed the Drapal Church to take control of almost all communes, establishing a de facto theocratic rule under the façade civilian government of Čalfa.|In foreign policy, the new regime was marked by the formation of the international Christian organisation Generation 21, which began an active programme of voluntary resettlement of Christians from the Middle East and Asia to Czechoslovakia, aiming to create there a centre of world refuge for Christians from persecution. The organisation was soon joined by Protestant churches in Germany, and then by charismatic churches in many other European countries, thus beginning a massive process of resettlement of Christians to Europe from other parts of the world.\r\nWith the financial, administrative, and agent support of the government, the Church of the Czech Brethren was finally able to overcome differences and develop a unified solution to various theological and ecclesiological issues. However, the solution was not what the right-wing opposition or the liberal intelligentsia wanted...|First of all, the clergy declared Jesus Christ to be the first socialist and Christian doctrine to be \"inseparable from socialist doctrine\". The assertion of the \"collective beginning of man\" and a \"return to the original pre-Roman Christian tenets\" was adopted, including the fight against bureaucracy, corruption, hierarchy and the struggle for a communitarian order of life. The Church of the Czech Brethren not only received support and the lifting of restrictions on preaching and the expansion of churches and Christian communes, but also began to actively preach its version of Christianity by spreading missionaries to many different countries.|And all this multi-purpose scheme ended up with the fact that even the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CHP, Jakes, in a public speech called Jesus Christ \"the political inspiration of all socialism and our party in particular\", and the programme included the thesis of \"full cooperation with the Church of the Czech Brethren\". Thereafter, the clergy of this church suddenly began to freely visit schools and other educational institutions to give sermons and \"moral lessons\".| But it was not only the \"Christianisation\" of the state and society that limited the changes in Czechoslovakia in order to preserve the ruling regime. In the economy, the state returned to \"wage inequality\" and \"the active use of commodity-money mechanisms in the socialist economy\". In practice, this began to mean that the state brought down the plans required for fulfilment, but did not control the ways in which they were implemented and the interactions between the legal participants in the market. At the same time, fulfilment of the plan was mandatory and failure to fulfil the plan was punishable by punishment ranging from dismissal to imprisonment. However, while an analogue of free market regulation was actually implemented at the production level, goods were obliged to be provided to the final consumer - the ordinary citizen - in accordance with the GOST quality and at the price approved by the state. Thus, an unusual economic system was formed, where the state demands some decisions and fulfilment of plans, but the ways of their implementation are left solely to the shoulders of state enterprises and collective farms. At the same time, the end consumer does not experience all the charms of a market economy, which is created within the state economic apparatus.\r\nIt's just the way it is.\r\nRomanian gambit\r\nCeausescu has been ruling Romania for many years and the huge foreign loans he initiated were spent inappropriately, forcing the government into austerity. This led to a significant reduction in living standards: food stamps, limits on electricity, gas and petrol were introduced, working hours were increased, and the country began to promote \"diets\" and large children. Not everyone, however, in the ruling party agrees with the current state of affairs, but such dissenters Ceausescu and his wife seek to actively remove from politics. One such dissenting leader is Gheorghe Apostol, who was sent as ambassador to various South American countries in 1977. He criticised the Ceausescu couple for nationalism and excessive yaksha with imperialists. Another dissenting leader is Ion Iliescu, who was pushed into the position of chairman of the National Water Council. In this position, he actively criticised the President for wasteful spending on gigantic and inefficient projects. However, the Ceausescu couple do not yet have enough power and influence in the party to finally expel them both from the Central Committee, thus eliminating them altogether. So maybe we should take advantage of the situation? We could secretly conspire with party figures to bring Gheorghe Apostol to Bucharest for an extraordinary congress of the RCP. We could also make arrangements with the \"Group of Intellectuals\", Ceausescu's closest associates, led by Ion Totu, who already believe that Nicolae's image has been tarnished by the austerity regime and that he should be replaced by his son. And to help any of them we will have to partially repay the Romanian foreign debt.\r\nGheorghe Apostol is the best option (-20.0 money)\r\nBecome a mediator between the Ceausescu couple and the ‘group of intellectuals’\r\nDon't interfere, it's not time yet\r\nYou don't have enough agents, you need 25.0.\r\nThe extraordinary convocation of the Congress of the RCP threw the Ceauşescu faction into turmoil; they were not prepared for this. At the Congress, Gheorghe Apostol sharply criticised the \"insane waste, bourgeois nationalism and acquiescence to the imperialists\", after which he was supported by Ilie Verdec, dissatisfied with economic policy; Ion Iliescu, a long-time opponent of the regime; Janos Fazekas, a critic of nationalism; Cornel Burtica, an opponent of religious repression; Ioan Ceterchi, a lawyer; Ioan Totu, a financier and opponent of austerity; and other prominent members of the Central Committee. In the end, by a majority vote, the Congress removed Ceausescu, who refused to resign, from all posts and decided to expel him from the party. Following this, his wife Elena, his first son Nicu Ceausescu, the couple's closest associate Ion Dincă, their confidant Emil Bobu and the current Prime Minister Constantin Descălescu are also expelled. Gheorghe Apostol was also unanimously elected as the new General Secretary of the RCP Central Committee, while Ilie Verdec returned to the post of Prime Minister. After the congress, the new rulers announced to the people the gradual end of the austerity regime within 12 months.\r\nHaving enough influence to persuade Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, we held a round table between him, our representative and a ‘group of intellectuals’ who had previously been close loyalists of the Ceausescu family and had actively participated in the establishment of his personality cult. These several people included the Director of the Institute of Economic Research Ion Totu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Stefan Andrei, the country's chief censor Dumitru Popescu nicknamed ‘God’, the Secretary for Ideology Paul Niculescu-Mizil and the President of the Parliament Nicolae Josan.| It was agreed that with our financial assistance the austerity regime would be significantly reduced and Nicolae Ceausescu would create a new stable succession institution. However, the eyes of both groups fell on the option of a victorious Juche in Korea, as this satisfied the interests of both the Ceausescu couple and the ‘group of intellectuals’. The ‘reforms’ began...\r\nThe defeat of a dictator\r\nGheorghe Apostol abolished all laws related to the cult of personality and nationalism, rehabilitated party colleagues repressed under Ceausescu, including Constantin Parvulescu and Alexandru Birladeanu, co-opting them to the Central Committee, stopped the persecution of national minorities and, with our financial assistance, abolished the austerity regime. The Romanian economy and population were able to breathe easy. Subsequently, the Romanian government reduced economic contacts with the West to a minimum and withdrew from the IMF, completely reorienting trade towards socialist and third world countries. Thus, the debunking of the cult of the Ceausescu family took place together with the debunking of the principle of cooperation with the imperialists.| In the economy, the new government began a gradual programme of leaving the oil needle in favour of the development of heavy industry, with further exports of machine tools and weapons to the Third World in order to obtain funds for the full development of the domestic economy. At the same time, the legalisation of collective farm markets and cooperatives, which did not work on state orders, but with the right to sell goods directly to the population, was restored.| Thus, the Romanian regime stabilised and overcame all the excesses and mistakes of the Ceausescu regime.\r\nIn the course of the new reforms, first of all, a new ‘National Historical Institute’ was created, headed by the famous anti-Semitic, anti-Gypsy and anti-Magyar poet and writer Corneliu Vadim Tudor and the national communist and anti-intellectual Eugen Barbu. Together with the Ceauşescu family and a ‘group of intellectuals’, on the basis of Juche and the ‘Romanian national experience’, they developed a ‘new current of Marxism’ - Saturnalia. Yes, this new theory proclaimed Romanians as the only and true direct descendants of the Roman Empire.| Within its framework, the Ceauşescu family was declared ‘the advanced vanguard of Romanians’ and ‘great leaders’, ‘the only ones able to lead Romania towards communism and the greatness of the nation’. Nicu Ceausescu was elected as the new Secretary General while his father remained as President. Ultra-nationalist propaganda began in the country, the gradual deportation of Hungarians to Hungary and Gypsies to Moldavia, the search for and pompous presentation of new evidence of ‘the historical and national succession of Rome’.| New Romanian textbooks and brochures on Marxism began to inculcate exclusive loyalty to the Ceauşescu family and to justify its supremacy and even primacy over the Party. The slogans ‘The Party obeys Ceausescu’ and ‘First are the leaders, Second are the Party, Third are the army’ became official.| Having ‘cleansed’ the country of Hungarians and Gypsies, censorship was tightened, televisions and radios were produced mechanically tuned to state programmes only, and monthly checks were introduced to check for ‘irregularities’, which were punishable by criminal sentences. | After Nicolae Ceausescu's death, his wife Elena was elected Secretary General and Nicu became President. Under him, the country opened its own factories for the production of sweets and fast food products, which did not just copy popular Western products, but even their design and style. The first domestic fast food chains also appeared in the country. At the same time, under Nicu's patronage, state rock and pop music ensembles appeared, albeit with a repertoire predominantly patriotic and often military| After the death of Elena Ceausescu, the Secretary General, under President Nicu, became his nephew Daniel Valentin. And after Nicu's death, he becomes President, combining these positions. Despite this strengthening of authoritarianism, the country began to actively develop research institutes, electronics, mobile communications and production of mobile phones. However, Romania managed to become a truly significant force in the international arena after the breakthrough in its own nuclear programme. It did not take long for the country to be proclaimed a nuclear power.\r\nElena Ceausescu sends her regards to all dissidents and oppositionists.\r\nGerman responsibility\r\nNow that we have stabilised the situation in Poland, very interesting information has surfaced. It turns out that during the crisis in Poland, East Germany was not slumbering and its actions can even be taken as a variant of the awakening of German revanchism. For example, GDR Defence Minister Heinz Hoffmann made plans to turn Polish Silesia into a joint Soviet-Czechoslovak-East German protectorate. Official GDR propaganda moulded the image of Poland as \"a country of rampant inflation, drug addiction and plunder\". And the grass-roots functionaries of the SED directly accused the Poles of \"treason against socialism\", suggested that \"order should be restored in Poland by the forces of the GDR and the USSR\" and even expressed doubts as to whether \"the Oder-Neisse border should have been recognised so early\". In Moscow they do not attach much importance to this because the situation with Poland has already been resolved and therefore everything has stabilised. But should we keep silent? Maybe we should use our and Polish newspapers for a mass criticism of the East German reaction? Or even involve Erich Honecker's rivals on the party line? Is the game of replacing the GDR leadership worth the effort?\r\nMake \"war\" on the press (-5.0 money)\r\nPitting party members against each other and promoting a compromise candidate (-25.0 agents)\r\nPitting party members against each other (-15.0 agents, -5.0 money)\r\nWe're fine with that, too\r\nTogether with our allies, we launched a print campaign in many media against the \"revival of East German revanchism\"; these articles penetrated the GDR and were discussed on a mass level in many parties around the world. This situation led to the fact that the ideology secretary Hager was forced to resign and was followed by Erich Honecker's retirement \"of his own accord\". Ironically, the conservative Willy Stof took over as ideology secretary, while the moderate reformists Egon Krenz and Sindermann took over as General Secretary of the SED Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, respectively. East Germany was to face a succession of reforms as part of the continuation of Ulbricht's curtailed policies.\r\nWe reported through the diplomatic line to Moscow that Honecker's \"German social miracle\" was based on huge loans from the FRG, which were quietly taken through third campaigns through the curator of these operations, Günter Mittag, who was actually the second man in the GDR after Erich Honecker. Thus we have presented the situation that all the work of the GDR government to establish relations with the FRG was only a screen for this extremely negative, dangerous and revisionist approach. However, when, after a wave from Moscow, the party \"orthodoxies\" Stof, Milke and Krolikowski denounced and removed Erich Honecker, Günther Mittag, Egon Krenz and Horst Sindermann, we did not give them time to \"settle down\" and, together with our allies, launched a print campaign in a multitude of media against the \"revival of East German revanchism\", these articles penetrated the GDR and were discussed on a mass level in many parties of the world. As a consequence of this blow, the Secretary for Ideology, Kurt Hager, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Willy Stof, and the head of the Stasi, Errich Milke, had already had to resign. There was a political vacuum at the top in East Germany, and our mediation came in handy. With our support, a young candidate, Günter Schabowski, became the new Secretary General, who had previously happily agreed to work with us and to allow our workers and our campaigns into the GDR. The Stasi was headed by Hermann Axen, a breakthrough and successful communist who turned East Germany into the third foreign policy power in the world. The Council of Ministers was headed by technocrat Alfred Neumann. And the secretary for ideology was Konrad Naumann, hated by the intelligentsia but widely supported by the Komsomol, ordinary Communists and workers.\r\nWe reported through the diplomatic line to Moscow that Honecker's \"German social miracle\" was based on huge loans from the FRG, which were quietly taken through third campaigns through the curator of these operations, Günter Mittag, who was actually the second man in the GDR after Erich Honecker.

In East Germany, a political vacuum was created at the top, and this was exploited by Konrad Naumann, hated by the intelligentsia but popular among the Komsomol, ordinary Communists and workers, who became the new General Secretary at the extraordinary congress of the SED. The Stasi was headed by Hermann Axen, a breakthrough and successful communist who turned East Germany into the third foreign policy power in the world. The Council of Ministers was headed by the pragmatist Gerhard Schürer. And Joachim Hermann, who had no political ambitions of his own and had previously held all the media in a tight fist of the party's general line, became the secretary for ideology.      \r\nEast Germans will remember their Prussian past\r\nThe Red Gene Theory is accepted\r\nEastern Question\r\nThe new GDR government was immediately confronted with a huge foreign debt and a massive import dependency, which led to the decision to introduce drastic economic reforms. First of all, Ulbricht's New Economic System was revised, but historically it had shown its failure in the long term, initially giving an increase, but after seven years - a significant drop in all indicators. It was therefore decided to develop a completely new economic policy based on previous mistakes and experiences. In the first place, it was not to include wage labourers in private business. Secondly, the self-management of state-owned enterprises showed an excessive level of production egoism. Thirdly, a complete reorganisation of the light industry, consumer goods and services was a prerequisite. The way out of this situation was a project called in the foreign press \"state syndicalism\": while the state retained direct control and subordination of the strategically important areas of the economy and the banking and financial sector, in other areas it was decided to implement a five-year plan of transition to free non-capitalist forms of ownership, namely the self-employed, artels and cooperatives. During these five years, favourable and encouraging conditions for the organisation of these forms of ownership should be created, bureaucracy and paperwork for them should be reduced, and the transfer of enterprises and organisations (light industry, consumer goods and services) to the cooperative ownership of workers and peasants should take place. At the same time, a gradual deregulation of prices in the economy would be implemented.| Ultimately, this unusual development plan created a unique form of economy and allowed East Germany to easily pay off its foreign debt, but the problems of import dependency can only be solved by further reform and planning projects.\r\nOn coming to power, Günter Schabowski, nicknamed by his fellow party members \"Wendehals\" for his lack of a coherent ideological position and his constant change of opinion to suit every situation, organised a showy unification congress of all the parties of the National Front into the People's-Labour United Party of Germany, centred on the Central Committee of the former SED \"to strengthen the power of the workers and peasants\".  However, along with the unification, members of the governing bodies of all the other parties loyal to the government were co-opted into the new Central Committee. Although the programme of the new party was in fact a copy of the former SED programme, some changes were made in it, namely the clauses on the protection of freedom of conscience and the protection of Germany's cultural, religious and historical heritage. To ordinary citizens, these changes appeared to be just another simple cosmetic reform, but in fact it was a huge preparatory step for a radical reshuffle - not only was it the first time in the history of the GDR that East Germany recognised its connection to its past and refused to break with it completely in order to build \"from scratch a new pure nation\", but Schabowski also thus diluted the Central Committee with Germanophile, religious and traditionalist cadres from other parties, paving the way for fundamental reforms. The Prussianness of the GDR was emphasised in propaganda, new symbols, textbooks and cultural programmes. Even the names of offices and bodies were changed to the old style.|At the same time, all dissenters were \"allowed\" to leave the country, which was taken advantage of, but it reduced the number of opposition in the country. Schabowski then concluded a concordat with the German Protestant Church, and priests even returned to schools.|With the reorganisation of the national, cultural and social spheres came changes in the economy. The OSNP (state trade union) was reorganised into several independent guilds, which were given the right to negotiate with company directors and party representatives. And to combat the country's heavy dependence on imports, subsidies began to subsidise a \"return to the traditional way of life\" - to the land, to the countryside, to farming. Under the slogan \"Be protected from any crisis\", people were encouraged (including by means of benefits and subsidies) to move to villages and set up their own vegetable gardens and farms. And the vacant jobs in the cities were replaced by Chinese contract labour migrants. This situation reduced both budgetary expenditures and food shortages in the country, and at the same time reoriented the people from discontent to \"working for themselves on the land\".| Eventually, even the GDR was renamed the Prussian Democratic Republic, and the \"conservative revolution\" and \"rural lifestyle\" became the basis of the latest programme of the People's Labour Party. And Western countries have decided to collectively impose both economic and personal sanctions on such an ‘inhumane authoritarian dictatorship.’\r\nWhen Konrad Naumann came to power, he was concerned with \"returning the party to its popular roots\" and combating the \"detachment of party functionaries\". The right of voters to recall deputies was introduced, the right of workers' collectives to dismiss directors was introduced, electronic reception centres for the Presidency administration were organised, and party members themselves were obliged to travel exclusively by public transport and to hold all meetings openly and live. Nauman himself was not afraid of such changes, being a straightforward man who easily found common ground with ordinary workers and rank-and-file party members, organising parties and drinks with them. This closeness to the people he would try to instil in the entire SED in the future.| In cultural policy Naumann announced a New Cultural Revolution, but not along the lines of Mao, but along the \"lines of Lenin\": travel to the capitals (and to the FRG) was completely banned, party workers and artists were now only allowed to travel to socialist countries; the re-promotion of the \"Soviet avant-garde\" and the fight against \"bourgeois art\" began, and attacks on postmodernist art and Western modernism were launched. Along with this, rock, rap, punk and meth were allowed, but only in the form of \"socialist meaning.\" During one of his speeches, Nauman even declared that \"at least the majority of artists and writers are essentially idiots\", after which mass dismissals took place across the ranks of the art councils and new young talents took their places.|In economics, Nauman was faced with a huge foreign debt and \"an economic policy that contradicted the interests of the workers and the decisions of the Eighth Party Congress of 1971\". To meet this challenge, the OSNP (the state trade union) was given a voice in the formation of the five-year plan, its official representatives became mandatory participants in Politburo meetings at the national level, lower-level representatives became participants in local party meetings with voting rights, and labour collectives were given a similar voice among their enterprises and local planning bodies. In this way workers were able to participate and intervene in the work of the planning committee, party meetings and enterprises.It cannot be said that this radically changed the situation in the country because of the passivity of the population and the bureaucratisation of the organs, but the simple and charismatic \"Connie\", from all corners of the newspapers, radio and television, began to urge the people to use their opportunities and \"show the bureaucracy and the idle economists their place\", so that the masses of the people gradually began to use their new opportunities and rights, and t h e y began to take advantage of their new opportunities and rights. The renewal of East Germany from the grassroots (while maintaining the one-party planned economy) has begun!\r\nNothing interesting.\r\nTan Lifu will be the new ruler\r\nNorth Korea has won the new Korean War\r\nThere's a monarchy in the country\r\nGheorghe Apostol abolished all laws related to the cult of personality and nationalism, rehabilitated all those expelled from the party under Ceausescu, restored Hungarian autonomy and, with our financial assistance, abolished the austerity regime. The Romanian economy and population were able to breathe easy. The Romanian government subsequently reduced economic contacts with the West to a minimum and withdrew from the IMF, completely reorienting trade towards socialist and Third World countries.|However, the Soviet radical reforms undermined ties in the socialist camp, as well as the socialist camp itself, which severely affected Romania's economy, which was under Western sanctions, and disgruntled Romanian nationalists began to riot.|In this situation, a group of Romanian nationalists from the ruling party, led by Alexandru Birladeanu, ousted Gheorghe Apostol and his associates and came to power.|In his first speech, Byrledeanu declared that the previous leadership was carrying out a systematic degradation of the Romanian nation, and in the framework of the cancellation of this policy, the first step would be the re-abolition of Hungarian autonomy. The new regime thus diverted the discontent of the Romanian nationalist masses to clashes with disgruntled Hungarians.|At the same time, much more significant reforms were taking place: Anna Pauker's ‘Moscow faction’ was rehabilitated, rural collectivisation was abolished (with a return to private farming), and the National Tsaranist Party was re-established, but its former leader Corneliu Coposu refused to cooperate with the communist regime. The more compliant Andrei Marga, known in the West for his national-liberal rhetoric but a secret agent of the Securitate, became head of the party. The National Liberal Party was also reconstituted, headed by the also compliant Alexandru Paleologou, a member of this party since before the war, and also a secret agent of the Securitate. And the ruling Communist Party itself was renamed the People's Labour Party of Greater Romania. Then the National Salvation Front was formed on the basis of these three parties, so that, regardless of the number of votes received in the elections, all three parties began to occupy the same number of seats in the parliament and to distribute the same number of portfolios in the government. The only thing that was affected by the elections was which of the three parties would appoint the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the President was given much more powers than before and was elected by the Parliament for a term of 7 years, and the first President, of course, was Alexandru Byrledeanu himself.|In the framework of economic reforms, ‘national corporatism’ was declared as a new formation, which led to the division of all spheres of economy into production associations according to the sector of economy, and the enterprises within these associations became fully self-governing. The unified trade union was also divided - each production association now had its own trade union structure. At the same time, most prices other than basic prices were deregulated, and Western sanctions were lifted. Now the business administration of enterprises itself approves directors from its own ranks, and labour collectives have been given the opportunity to fight for their rights through a decentralised trade union system, which in the conditions of deregulation and transition to a market economy should be a counterbalance to each other. And the state will continue to be the main supervisor over all economic structures and spheres.\r\nGheorghe Apostol abolished all laws related to the cult of personality and nationalism, rehabilitated all those expelled from the party under Ceausescu, restored Hungarian autonomy and, with our financial assistance, abolished the austerity regime. The Romanian economy and population were able to breathe easy. Subsequently, the Romanian government reduced economic contacts with the West to a minimum and withdrew from the IMF, completely reorienting trade towards socialist and Third World countries.| However, the Soviet radical reforms undermined ties in the socialist camp, as well as the socialist camp itself, which seriously affected Romania's economy, which was under Western sanctions, and disgruntled Romanians and Hungarians began to riot.| In this situation, a group of Romanian reformists from the ruling party, led by Silviu Brucan, ousted Gheorghe Apostol and his associates and came to power.|At the same time, the new regime entered into negotiations with the discontented masses, promising swift reforms to stabilise the state and ‘renew socialism’.|The next step was the development and implementation of a programme of transition to a social market economy: based on the Swedish and Norwegian models, Romania's 1200 economists drafted a ‘five-year plan’ for privatisation of all spheres of the economy (including the banking sector) while keeping strategically important sectors of the economy in the hands of the state, full legalisation of private business (including corporations and foreign business), privatisation of housing, restoration of social guarantees, benefits and services, deregulation of prices, free currency conversion and reduction of duties.|The government and the reform commission were headed by Casimir Ionescu, who secretly had contacts (and even friendship) with Romanian military and Securitatu figures. Under his leadership, limited liberalisation of the regime began - the Securitate were renamed into Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) and formally deprived of the right to prosecute for political crimes, political censorship was abolished but replaced by the ‘Committee for the Protection of National Values’, multi-partyism was legalised, but the secret services tried to bring the parties together and split them into small movements. Even the symbols and the name of the country were changed to national-neutral, but no real democratisation took place. Quasi-democratic social capitalism, welcomed by Western countries, was simply established in the country.\r\nIn the course of the new reforms, first of all, a new ‘National Historical Institute’ was created, headed by the famous anti-Semitic, anti-Gypsy and anti-Magyar poet and writer Corneliu Vadim Tudor and the national communist and anti-intellectual Eugen Barbu. Together with the Ceauşescu family and a ‘group of intellectuals’, on the basis of Juche and the ‘Romanian national experience’, they developed a ‘new current of Marxism’ - Saturnalia. Yes, this new theory proclaimed Romanians as the only and true direct descendants of the Roman Empire.| Within its framework, the Ceauşescu family was declared ‘the advanced vanguard of Romanians’ and ‘great leaders’, ‘the only ones able to lead Romania towards communism and the greatness of the nation’. But the attempt at the new congress to elect his son Nicu Ceausescu as General Secretary, so that Nicolae himself would still be President of Romania, was the last straw for the party members. As a result, with Moscow's mediation, all opposition elements in the party united around Ion Iliescu against a ‘revisionist neo-monarchist anti-party group’.| Soon the Ceausescu couple and the ‘group of intellectuals’ were condemned and expelled from the party. The Ceausescu couple, their associates and the ‘group of intellectuals’ were tried on charges of ‘corruption, nepotism, destroying the Romanian economy and driving the people into poverty’, all were found guilty and sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.| The new government declared a ‘commitment to the world socialist experience’ and a ‘rejection of the old Stalinist methods’. As part of this, forced urbanisation of the countryside was halted and collective farms were gradually replaced by family contracting. Small and medium-sized private business was legalised. Thus, the state slowly transferred most of the services and light industry to private ownership, while cautiously liberalising prices.| In the arts, there was a partial thaw and youthful genres and works ‘not undermining Romania's national security’ were allowed through censorship. Abroad, Iliescu's new regime has already been dubbed ‘ciorbă communism’ by analogy with ‘goulash communism’.|In foreign policy, Romania has become Moscow's closest and most loyal ally. At the same time, relations with offshore countries (Luxembourg, Cyprus, Monaco, etc.) and second world countries (Brazil, Syria, etc.) are being established. \r\nArgentina, Brazil and Uruguay are pro-China\r\nRelations with the US less than\r\nRelations with the USSR less than\r\nWhy do we need these liberals? Let us demand the return of the orthodox Titoists!\r\nWe remain loyal to reformism, so Yugoslavia should too\r\nHaving bought the bonds, we, with its help, put pressure on the leadership of the LCY and offered to return the orthodox to the levers of power in exchange for the nullification of the debt.\r\nThe YNA leadership called Šešelj and guaranteed the troops' loyalty to the President. Vojislav, confident of success, was then able to send the Drašković government into retirement and the new cabinet was headed by Dragoslav Bokan, the leader of the youth wing of the Serbian nationalists. Martial law was then declared throughout Yugoslavia and secession was declared illegal. The army then occupied Slovenia without any problems. The operation there went quickly and quietly primarily because Šešelj sowed fear among the civilian population by threatening to blow up the Slovenian nuclear power plant in response to European outrage and sanctions. However, Croatia and Bosnia, where on the background of the nationalists' victory in Belgrade Islamic radicals managed to seize power, managed to mobilise territorial defence, but then Serbian armed uprisings started in their rear. A long and bloody war ensued.|At the same time, the Yugoslav leadership tried to stabilise the situation in the country, boost morale and restore its image by restoring the monarchy. However, the Karadjordjevic dynasty disagreed with Šešelj, accusing him of bloodshed and despotism. So it was decided to put on the throne the Montenegrin dynasty of Petrovic-Negosha, namely the conservative traditionalist Nikola, which, of course, could only partially satisfy Šešelj's plans.|The civil war in Yugoslavia thus lasted 6 years, with the Chetniks on the side of the government and the tacit support of China and its allies, and the European Union and the United States on the side of the separatists. The war exhausted both sides and in the end, mediated by Beijing, a shaky peace was signed between the parties: Croatia lost Serbian Krajina, which became part of Yugoslavia in its entirety, and also handed over the corridor to Slovenia. Bosnia lost Herceg-Bosna, which became part of Croatia, recognised Western Bosnia's leader Fikret Abdic as its president, and federalised the country while returning its membership to Yugoslavia. At the same time, Belgrade guaranteed Croatia's independence and the inalienable right of Bosnia and Slovenia to exist as states within the Yugoslavia itself. |After the end of the difficult war, the King of Yugoslavia also announced in a solemn ‘Victory Parade’ the reorganisation of Yugoslavia back into a unitary kingdom, where virtually all power passed into Serbian hands in the form of a ‘managed democracy’, when the only legal parties in the country were pro-Serb nationalist parties such as the ruling Serbian Radical Party, Kostunica's Democratic Party, Milosevic's Socialist Party and others, while communist and separatist ideologies and movements were banned. | The country began an active Serbisation of the population and the destruction of Bosniak and Macedonian identities. And with the full support of the Orthodox Church, bureaucratic persecution of atheists, Catholics and Protestants began.|The Kingdom's worst and best times have returned.\r\nThe military quickly brought troops into Belgrade and established martial law, recognising Šešelj as deposed and his party as neo-Nazi and therefore banned. The post of president was emptied ‘until new elections’ and Drašković and his cabinet became practically the sole rulers of the country, trying to avoid bloodshed in any way possible in deciding the fate of Yugoslavia. They entered into negotiations with the governments of Slovenia and Croatia and then, together, decided to reorganise Yugoslavia into the Commonwealth of Yugoslavia, Croatia and Slovenia. In fact, all that united the three countries was a single currency and a common migration and economic zone. Within Bosnia, Serbian and Croatian autonomies were formed, and within Serbia the autonomies of Kosovo and Vojvodina were restored. At the same time, separatist attempts to emerge in the new Yugoslavia were suppressed by intelligence services and bureaucratic procedures, demonstrating Draskovic's desire to maintain Serbian influence in the territories under his control. | Ultimately, the dissident democrat and moderate national liberal Vojislav Kostunica was elected president of the ‘old’ Yugoslavia, and the good-natured Bosnian millionaire Fikret Abdic was elected president of the Commonwealth, which was voted for by both Serbs, who saw him as a patriotic and democratic Yugoslavist, and Croats, who were confident that he would respect Croatia's new status in relation to Yugoslavia.| But what the future holds for such an organisation in a radically changing world is unknown.\r\nAfter becoming prime minister in 1984, Stane Dolanc gathered around him the most politically active opponents of nationalism and the break-up of Yugoslavia. The group included Ivan Stambolic, Stipe Šuvar, Lazar Mojsov, Petar Gračanin, Veljko Kadijević, Stevan Mirković, Branko Mamula and Nikola Ljubičić. In this way, Dolanc secured the support not only of the high-ranking heads of the Communist Party apparatuses, but also of the entire YNA leadership.|At the same time, Stane once again decided to resort to his old tactics and, through his people in the Interior Ministry and intelligence services, made arrangements with the underground underworld. After that, in exchange for funding, the ‘thieves-in-law’ began to assign their men to eliminate opposition leaders, dissidents and political activists. Soon even UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar accused the Yugoslav leadership of a tactic to lure political emigrants back to their homeland through amnesty in order to kill them there.|When the political killings led to popular unrest, Dolanc turned organised crime on them, which resulted in massacres in the streets. And under the pretext of this, the Prime Minister pushed through the imposition of martial law, curfews and police cordons throughout the country. However, the political killings continued, with the army and police merely suppressing opponents of the established regime| To stabilise the economy, after our debt relief, the country introduced a card system and temporary centralised management of state, mixed, cooperative and private enterprises. However, what was called temporary lasted for several years, which displeased a part of the group of politicians gathered around Dolanc.|\r\nUpon learning of the plot, Stane took advantage of the foreign policy stability and called an extraordinary congress, where he criticised the ‘anti-party bourgeois-liberal group’ of Stambolić, Šuvar and Mojsov. They were expelled from the party, and then, to the surprise of many, ‘for the sake of stability’ the Presidency is reorganised again into the sole office of President, which is held by Dolanc himself, and Prime Minister is appointed a military man of Serbo-Croatian origin, Veljko Kadijevic, who declares himself a ‘Yugoslav’ by nationality. Thereafter, all Yugoslav heads of government would officially assume the nationality ‘Yugoslav’ before taking office.|A year later, martial law was abolished, as was the card system, and the economy returned to limited self-government. At the same time, Kadijević resigned and became Minister of Defence in the new government headed by Stevan Mirković.|The previous situation, however, forced the new president not only to change the political apparatus, but also his tactics and approaches to governing the country. The nationality column in all documents is abolished, nationalities are no longer counted in any bodies and the creation of national organisations is forbidden.|However, much more serious reforms take place in the country: a ‘Tito Centre’ is formed to ‘study the ways of applying Titoism’, a general line of Titoism is introduced and now everyone must follow it and ideologically be exclusively within the framework of Titoism, and any evaders are excluded from everything and given the status of an enemy of the people. Thus keeping the whole state in check and forbidding reforms as a whole.|However, economic crises still ‘visited’ the country from time to time every few years and to solve them, a programme of complete abolition of money was finally adopted: enterprises switched to direct commodity exchange and the final product was given to the population on cards issued by the local authorities depending on the ‘contribution of each individual person’. |However, this cannot go on forever and the legacy of Dolanc, who calls himself ‘the last Titoist’, is cracking under its own weight.\r\nTaking advantage of the foreign policy situation, a group of ‘conspirators’ led by Stambolić, Šuvar, Mojsov and Mirković convened an extraordinary congress, where they criticised Stane Dolancs for voluntarism, ‘excesses’ and ‘negligence that led to casualties’. Eventually, both Dolanc himself and his closest associates - Gracanin, Kadijević and Ljubičić - were expelled from the party and from all positions. The new government was headed by Stipe Šuvar himself.|He officially announced that ‘the country needs reforms’, abolishing martial law, the card system and the direct management of the economy by the state. However, police cordons, curfews and excessive powers of the security services remained in place, while the political reforms were merely cosmetic - the Union of Communists of Yugoslavia was renamed to the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, local Communist parties were renamed to Socialist parties, and ‘Titoism’ and ‘Yugoslav socialism’ became the official ideology instead of Marxism-Leninism. However, while the political reforms were cosmetic, it allowed the powers of the local governing parties be reduce, and centralised around a single SPJ, which began to independently elect the body of the Presidency of Yugoslavia. |In the economy, however, a thaw did take place: partial deregulation of prices, privatisation of state enterprises into the hands of cooperative owners and encouragement of the development of independent cooperative enterprises and organisations, including the legalisation of cooperative banks and credit organisations.  The government even presented the slogan ‘Everything that the market can do - the market must do, as long as there is no private business’. And the economic obligations of the state were reduced to a minimum, thus forming the world's first Left-Minarchist experiment.|A few years later, Stipe Šuvar officially resigned as Prime Minister, being elected Chairman of the SFRY Presidium, while retaining his role as General Secretary of the SPJ Central Committee. Lazar Mojsov, an experienced diplomat, became the new head of government, trying to find a compromise with the outside world and ‘playing on several foreign policy sides’, creating investment attraction centres and offshore zones, while protecting the established ‘self-governing economy’.|However, this could not go on forever and a few years after Stipe Šuvar's death, Yugoslavia was again forced to take on huge debts all over the world, gradually falling back into a deep debt hole.\r\n"
